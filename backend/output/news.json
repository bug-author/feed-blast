Since the enabling expression of “may be released on bail” is used in this part, read with the basic principles of criminal justice, the grant of bail in a non-bailable offence that does not fall within the second part of Section 497(1) CrPC is said to be a rule and refusal an exception.\n\n\"The second part of Section 497(1) CrPC provides that an accused shall not be released on bail if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for ten years. This part of Section 497(1) CrPC which prohibits the grant of bail in certain offences is popularly known as the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\"\n\nHowever, the order said that the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC provides that the court may direct that any person under the age of sixteen years or any woman or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be released on bail.\n\nThe expression “such an offence” used in this proviso refers to the offence mentioned in the second part (prohibitory clause) of Section 497(1) CrPC, as for all other non-bailable offences the court is already empowered to release the accused on bail under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nThe first proviso has thus made equal the power of the court to grant bail in the offences of prohibitory clause alleged against an accused under the age of sixteen years, a woman accused and a sick or infirm accused, to its power under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\n\"This means that in cases of women, etc., as mentioned in the first proviso to Section 497(1), irrespective of the category of the offence, bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as an exception in the same manner as it is granted or refused in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nExceptions\n\nThe apex court also noted that the exceptions for refusing bail in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC are therefore also applicable to the accused who pray for bail under the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC in an offence falling within the prohibitory clause.\n\n“These exceptions are well settled by several judgements of this court. They are the likelihood of the accused: (a) to abscond to escape trial; (b) to tamper with the prosecution evidence or influence the prosecution witnesses to obstruct the course of justice; or (c) to repeat the offence keeping in view his previous criminal record, nature of the offence or the desperate manner in which he has prima facie acted in the commission of the offence.\"\n\nRegarding the case in hand, the bench noted that they do not find any material that would attract any of the above exceptions in order to refuse bail to the present petitioner.\n\n\"We are cognizant of the fact that the persons involved in the commission of offences of robbery or dacoity are usually professional criminals and there is a likelihood that they would repeat the offence if enlarged on bail. But the case of the present petitioner is distinguishable as she was working as a maid in the house of the complainant as per his own version, therefore, she does not appear to be a professional robber or dacoit and we do not find a likelihood of her repeating the offence if released on bail.\"\n\n\"The impugned order passed by the high court is, thus, not sustainable under the law and calls for interference by this Court. This petition is, therefore, converted into appeal and the same is allowed: the impugned order is set aside and the petitioner is admitted to post-arrest bail subject to her furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.\"\n\nThe court also noted that concession of bail may be cancelled by the competent court under Section 497(5) CrPC, if the petitioner misuses it in any manner, including causing a delay in the expeditious conclusion of the trial.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/SC1652779579-0/SC1652779579-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "PTI request in Toshakhana reference rejected", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372689/pti-request-in-toshakhana-reference-rejected", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:39:57 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday rejected PTI’s plea to grant a three-week time to provide documents in the reference seeking disqualification of party chief Imran Khan for not sharing details of Toshakhana gifts, directing it to submit the same within a week.\n\nPTI chief Imran Khan’s counsel Barrister Gohar appeared before the ECP on Monday as a five-member commission headed by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja heard the reference.\n\nBarrister Khalid Ishaq appeared before the bench on behalf of the coalition government while petitioner Mohsin Nawaz Ranjha represented PML-N.\n\nAt the outset of the hearing, the PTI counsel insisted that the party needed at least three weeks to gather and furnish the documents relating to the declaration of assets.\n\n“We are reviewing whether someone has declared iPhone and watches in his assets declaration or not,” the counsel told the bench.\n\nHe further explained that since the ECP had to wrap up the case in three months, the party would rather submit its answer in tandem with another in a similar reference seeking Imran's disqualification.\n\nAt this, the CEC remarked that the PTI would nonetheless still have the documents disclosed in the ECP's report.\n\nHowever, Barrister Gohar Khan contended that PML-N's petitioner Mohsin Nawaz Ranjha should also submit the statements pertaining to his party's declaration of assets.\n\nChiming in, the petitioner replied that the failure of other parties to disclose their assets did not provide Imran Khan \"a licence to his assets\".\n\nThe hearing was then adjourned until August 29.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/ECP1640860350-0/ECP1640860350-0.jpeg"}, {"headline": "Lahore to Quetta train service suspended", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372688/lahore-to-quetta-train-service-suspended", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:39:32 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Pakistan Railways has suspended the train service between Sindh and Balochistan for the next two to three days, as rains and flash floods have inundated railway tracks and damaged bridges, officials said on Monday.\n\n“Our tracks and yards have been affected in Sindh and Balochistan due to heavy rains.

Likewise, when the FIR is registered then the court should also initiate a contempt proceedings or not.\n\nThe Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday decided to initiate contempt proceedings against Imran Khan for passing controversial remarks regarding female sessions court judge Zeba Chaudhry.\n\nAt a rally in Islamabad’s F-9 park on Saturday, Imran had threatened to file cases against Islamabad’s inspector general (IG) of police and deputy inspector general (DIG) of police and declared: “We won’t spare you.” He then warned the judiciary against its “biased” attitude towards his party, saying that it should brace itself for the consequences.\n\nThis is not the first time the court is taking up a contempt matter against Imran. However, the PTI chief has managed to secure relief in such cases.\n\nIn 2013, the top court had summoned cricketer-turned-politician Imran for a contempt hearing over his \"critical and derogatory\" remarks against the judiciary.\n\nImran, who had by then made a major breakthrough in the general election, had allegedly said that the polls were rigged and criticised the judiciary and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not taking notice.\n\n\"While holding press conference on 26.7.2013, he (Khan) stated that the role of judiciary and Election Commission of Pakistan is shameful in the conduct of general elections; that the elections were rigged, due to role played by these two institutions,\" the apex court’s notice read.\n\nHowever, in a major relief for Imran, the Supreme Court decided to drop contempt proceedings on the suggestion of the then attorney general for Pakistan Muneer A Malik.\n\nA three-member bench headed by Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali discharged the notice after hearing the arguments of AGP Munir in the case who said that it is not the matter of disobedience.\n\nThe judgment said that admittedly, Imran Khan is a public figure and duly elected member of the National Assembly who has not only been actively involved in politics for a considerable period, but also heads a political party.\n\n\"In such circumstances, while considering his conduct, we also cannot lose sight of the provision of Articles-19 and 66 of our Constitution, relating to freedom of speech and the privileges of members of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament).”\n\n\"Thus, at this juncture, as a note of caution, we may observe that politicians and other public figures having their say and a following amongst the public are expected to use more decent and guarded language and have to be more careful in the selection of words in public gatherings or press conferences so as to show their intellect, maturity of mind and wisdom qua respect to various national institutions, and to present themselves as role models for the society at large,” the judgement noted.\n\nSimilarly, earlier this year, the Supreme Court refused to initiate contempt proceedings against the PTI chief over the non-implementation of its May 25 order.\n\nThe apex court had issued clear instructions to hold its Azadi March protest near Peshawar Mor between the H-9 and G-9 areas of Islamabad. However, Imran and his protestors did make their way toward D-Chowk, prompting the government to call in the Pakistan Army for the security of the capital's Red Zone.\n\nThe apex court had formed a five-member larger bench, headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, to hear the application filed by Attorney General of Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf.\n\nHowever, SC Judge Justice Yahya Afridi, while dissenting with the majority order, observed that a contempt proceeding should be initiated against PTI chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan for instructing party activists and supporters to proceed toward D-Chowk in violation of the SC's May 25 order.\n\nHe noted that there was sufficient material before the SC to initiate a contempt proceeding against Imran Khan over violation of the May 25 order and instructed the party activists and supporters to proceed toward D-Chowk.\n\nHowever, instead of issuing a contempt notice, the majority judges on June 1 sought reports from director generals of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) as well as Islamabad IG police, interior secretary and others over the alleged involvement of PTI leaders in instigating party workers to reach Islamabad's D-Chowk in violation of its May 25 order.\n\nLater the court was apprised by the law enforcement agencies that a “crowd was organised to enter Red Zone under the PTI leadership who had reached Express Chowk with the intent to proceed further towards D-Chowk as per the directions of the party’s highest command”.\n\nThe matter is still pending in the apex court.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/court-hammer1658069967-0/court-hammer1658069967-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Administrative issues jack up NHA project costs", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372681/administrative-issues-jack-up-nha-project-costs", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:15:58 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe cost of 33 National Highway Authority (NHA) projects has increased from Rs79.5 billion in 2008 to Rs90.73 billion in 2021 due to non-availability of funds and delay in land acquisition.\n\nAccording to the documents available with The Express Tribune, between 2008 and 2021, 33 projects of the authority were completed at cost overruns.

My enthusiasm was further bolstered by the welcome board en route to Makkah which stated “Guests of Ar-Rahman, your safety is our responsibility”.\n\n\n\nOn July 7th, I joined the one million pilgrims – 1.5 million less than in 2019 – in Minna. This was the largest Hajj gathering since the pandemic had forced numbers to 10,000 Muslims in 2020 and 60,000 Muslims in 2021. Suffice to say, all eyes were on the Kingdom. This year’s Hajj also coincided with 100 years of Saudi Arabia’s organising of the annual pilgrimage. Hajj 1443 was made all the more special since it coincided with a Friday, making it Hajj-e-Akbar.\n\n\n\nCompared to my previous experience, the zeal among the pilgrims seemed somewhat diminished. At first, I believed these to be misapprehensions given the reduced numbers. However, increased interaction with my companions made me realise that the pandemic, circumventing all biases, had been hard on everyone regardless of stature. Without a doubt, Covid-19 has broken each and every one of us in some way. The white barrier between the Kabbah and pilgrims was a reinforcing testament to the ‘new normal’ we have all been forced to adopt.\n\n\n\nFrom my past encounters, I was on the lookout for miracles. And I was not disappointed. A friend had related that the people of Makkah claim that clouds provide shade to the Hujjaj. I witnessed this first hand on the Day of Arafat – considered the apex of Hajj – during which unexpected clouds started forming in a previously clear sky, thereby making it tolerable to sit outside in the 44-degree heat. The same happened during the rest of the pilgrimage days. Each ritual reaffirmed what I had grown up hearing: “Hajj sabr ka naam hai” (Hajj is the name of patience), which further reinforces the South African phrase “Umuntu Ngumuntu Ngabantu” (I am because of what we all are). This feeling, I believe now, is a miracle in itself.\n\n\n\nIn line with their Vision 2030, this year, the Kingdom had undertaken many experiments and introduced many changes, with mixed results. A major issue was for those journeying from America, Europe and Australia who had to apply for Hajj using an online portal. There was a lack of clarity in the draw process and mix ups, as a result of which, many people were turned back from the airport.\n\nHowever, this is not to take away from the many improvements I witnessed. In keeping with their national rejuvenation plans, the Saudis had increased the application of modern technology by harnessing the best electronic devices available. This included the “In your languages, we welcome you” campaign, which aims at guiding the pilgrims in 23 languages. This highlighted increased inclusivity and accommodation of pilgrims which I had previously not witnessed.\n\n\n\nA robot introduced in the Grand Mosque, Makkah to distribute Qurans to worshipers.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable sights for me was to see Hajjis zooming along on electric scooters. As a trial service, the Saudi Public Authority for Transport provided pilgrims with this service to help ease the time taken between Holy sites. For instance, the usually one-hour walk between Arafat to Muzdalifah was reduced to just 15 minutes. This is in addition to the Saudi Hajj Ministry’s adoption of smart technologies to help assure comfort of the Hajjis.\n\n\n\nBy the same token, there were visibly increased numbers of security officials and scouts to aid the pilgrims not only during the rituals but also in and around the Holy Mosques. Another marked change was the greater role of the youth in all areas of pilgrim assistance; be it spraying water on the pilgrims to provide relief from the heat or medics and security personnel.\n\nSimilarly, even though on previous visits I had noticed the expanding role of women in workplaces in the country, this time around it was very distinct. Now there were uniformed women officers inside the Mosque, women volunteers at the airport and even women administering passenger data input. These tasks had previously been reserved for men alone.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, after a two year international hiatus, Hajj 1443 was a success and a triumph for the Muslim ummah in the face of the trials and tribulations brought on by the pandemic. Restored, refreshed and recentered, I departed Madina airport, leaving a part of my soul in Makkah and a piece of my heart in the Prophet’s (PBUH) city.\n\n\nAll photos courtesy of the author.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1081507-HajjTawafKaabaAFP-1460156940/1081507-HajjTawafKaabaAFP-1460156940.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan and Iran: The potential for a great alliance", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97602/pakistan-and-iran-the-potential-for-a-great-alliance", "date_published": "Wed, 22 Jun 22 08:36:24 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMarred by sectarian violence, opposing interests, differing foreign policies and failed economic possibilities, Pakistan-Iran relations have soured throughout the years. As a result, Islamabad has seldom explored the possibility of deeper relations with its western neighbour.\n\nAlthough Pakistan and Iran co-operate on a multitude of different platforms and sectors, the degree of cooperation has often been tested, and a considerable amount of blame for this falls on Pakistan’s shoulders. Shackled by its external constraints, primarily in the form of American influence, the risk of Saudi alienation, and the sanctions on Iran, Pakistan has consistently remained reluctant to pursue deeper relations. Iran, on the other hand, has shown a willingness to strengthen bilateral ties, the chief example being the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline. Islamabad’s lack of interest has not gone unnoticed in Tehran.\n\nIndignant about Pakistan’s ambivalent foreign policy, Iran has sought a closer relationship with India, which has proven to be a resourceful and trustworthy partner. In direct competition with Pakistan’s Gwadar port, Indian support helped Iran mobilise Chabahar as a major oceanic port in the region. Furthermore, Indian influence in Iran has helped India to indirectly meet its nefarious interests against Pakistan, particularly vis-a-vis Balochistan and Southern Afghanistan. As a result, Islamabad’s lack of interest in seeking a meaningful relationship with Iran has weakened its overall influence and created a region where Pakistan is becoming increasingly cornered.\n\nHowever, the obstacles which once sought to hinder Pak-Iran relations are now beginning to wither away, paving the way for a potentially great alliance.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Pakistan faces when it comes to Iran is pressure from its ally, the United States (US). America has been explicitly vocal against any form of cooperation between Iran and Pakistan, and it is no secret that it has sabotaged numerous initiatives between the two nations. However, following the war in Ukraine, America has had a change of heart. With the threat of a severe energy crisis inexorably hitting the developed and developing world, America has confronted the situation by re-engaging with countries that it once had vowed to eschew.\n\nIn March 2022, after years of estrangement, a senior American delegation had a rare face-to-face meeting with the Nicolas Maduro government in Caracas, Venezuela, the world’s most oil-rich country. The meeting had a one-point agenda: replace Russian oil with Venezuelan oil. Similar energy-focused engagements with Libya have also been undertaken by the US. More interestingly, the Biden administration has felt the JCPOA agreement (Iran Nuclear Deal) should be revived to relieve Iran of its sanctions and benefit from its abundant gas and oil supplies. Talks in Vienna are already underway and major headway is being made, highlighting the possibility that a deal could once again be struck.\n\nAmerica’s change in position is driven purely out of necessity for its own self-interest; however, with no end in sight in Ukraine, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US is adopting softer attitudes toward its oil-rich adversaries, in particular Iran. For Pakistan, this is a now or never opportunity: capitalise on the west’s relaxation now and secure deals with Iran or delay the opportunity and ultimately face the wrath of the west.\n\nAnother hurdle Pakistan faces when it comes to Iran is the Saudi Arabian question. Any venture with Iran risks the upsetting of ‘brotherly’ Saudi Arabia, and although Pakistan has remained explicitly neutral in the pair’s cold war – through the training, support, and cooperation with its armed forces – it is clear that Islamabad indirectly sides with Riyadh. As a result, Pakistan’s alliance with the Saudis bars it from exploring real terms with Iran.\n\nIn the past year, however, there have been growing signs of rapprochement between the two arch rivals. Through the meditation of Iraq and Oman, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been willing to sit at the peace table and are now engaging in their fifth round of direct talks. Furthermore, with the cessation of hostilities in Yemen as well as the re-opening of the Iranian representative office in the OIC, analysts are hopeful that the two countries are finally coming to some form of an agreement, and the possibility of re-establishing diplomatic missions is not too far fetched.\n\nAs for Pakistani gains in light of such developments, they are significant. Not only can Islamabad now engage peacefully with Tehran, without alienating Saudi Arabia, but it can also facilitate further reconciliation between the two countries and emerge as a key mediator of peace in the region.\n\nWith the roadblocks to cooperation finally lifting, Pakistan and Iran can pave the way for a great alliance. This alliance can take two forms, one of an economic dimension and the other of a non-economic one. However, the beauty of a Pak-Iran alliance is not in its business prospective nor the cultural linkages but in the fact that it is mutually beneficial. At home, both Iran and Pakistan face pressing issues of different kinds, yet both sides can help each other solve their respective problems.\n\nThe major cornerstone of Pak-Iran relations has been the proposed Pakistan-Iran (IP) gas pipeline, a proposition which can mutually benefit both sides simultaneously. Stretching from South Pars all the way to Punjab, the 1900km pipeline would provide inestimable value for both Pakistan and Iran. As it currently stands, however, the IP gas pipeline is an opportunity fading away. Despite the project’s inception nearly a decade ago, the pipeline has yet to even start. Iran’s side of the pipeline is built but has simply been left to rust, while Pakistan’s side is waiting to start construction.\n\nThe causes of Pakistan’s lack of initiative is due to the abovementioned external pressure coupled with internal distrust, leading to the project’s early abandonment. However, this can all change. As stated before, Iran’s rapidly changing geopolitical image, as well as the easing of Pakistani challenges vis-a-vis foreign policy could usher in a new wave of enthusiasm. The IP gas pipeline could finally restart and ultimately benefit the two countries immensely.\n\nPlagued with severe energy shortages, depleting indigenous sources and inchoate industries, Pakistan is on the brink of energy starvation. So far, loans and expensive imports have kept the energy sector afloat, but these are short-term solutions and are unsustainable in the long run. As for local energy sources within the country, they too have proven insufficient.\n\nUltimately, Pakistan will need to increase its imported energy, preferably at cheap and subsidised rates. Once revived, however, the IP gas pipeline can solve the majority of these problems. Providing 22 million cubic metres of gas a day, and electricity generation equivalent to nearly 4,500 megawatts, the pipeline would be able to meet nearly all of Pakistan’s current electricity shortfall. Furthermore, compared to its current import from countries such as Qatar, Iranian LNG is far more affordable.\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, the IP gas pipeline can cement Pak-Iran relations and effectively thwart expanding Indian influence in the region. What’s more interesting is that in 2016, China expressed the desire to invest in the pipeline and expand it into its own borders. Iran welcomed Chinese interest and sweetened the deal by expressing interest in joining the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). If Iran joins, an unparalleled trifecta in the region could emerge, hence promoting development, peace and stability. Although it is too early to tell right now, initial willingness from different countries has shown that the IP gas pipeline could be a catalyst for extraordinary cooperation in the region and beyond.\n\nFor Iran, the IP gas pipeline could provide much-needed relief to its ailing economy. Crippled by years of brutal sanctions, Iran has failed to effectively monetise its abundant oil and gas supplies, and as a result, has suffered from abysmally low GDP figures. Notably absent from LNG and oil markets, Iran is missing out and is eager to establish itself as a force in the economic world. Moreover, Iran has lacked an iron brother-like alliance with any of its neighbours to assist in alleviating its crises. For example, Iraq is embroiled in constant turmoil and lacks stability for any strong alliance to emerge, while neighbours in the Caucasus do not see eye-to-eye with Iran. However, an economic alliance with Pakistan is not only stable and safe, but the market of 220 million people can provide ample opportunity for Iran to fulfil its economic needs.\n\nOver the past decades, an environment of trepidation and apprehension has developed in place of a potentially fraternal relationship between Pakistan and Iran. The two countries have continually looked away from one another, opting to search thousands of miles away for rather unsustainable and short-lived alliances. However, as Pakistan and Iran unshackle themselves from the constraints of geopolitics, they must look towards one another for a better future.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/image1654671439-0/image1654671439-0.png"}, {"headline": "Does gun control even matter to GOP members and the NRA?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97595/does-gun-control-even-matter-to-gop-members-and-the-nra", "date_published": "Tue, 07 Jun 22 11:29:25 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMass shootings are gaining renewed momentum across the United States (US) in light of the Texas school shooting and Memorial Day gun violence in Chicago. The former incident is said to be the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook. These are just a few instances of gun violence that get plastered all over the news, and rightfully so.\n\nAccording to Gun Violence Archive, there have been at least 246 mass shootings in the US so far this year, far more than the number of days passed in 2022. More than 2,000 American teenagers between the ages 12 to 17 have been shot dead or injured this year. There have been 8,346 gun-related deaths, 15,768 injuries and 634 unintentional shootings. Moreover, 473 children between ages zero to 11 years were shot during the first half of this year. What also appears to be gripping parts of the US are imitation mass murders. Following the Memorial Day shootings, there have been 13 others this past weekend, leaving more than a dozen dead and at least 70 injured. Gun violence is an act of terrorism that is encouraging repressed individuals to come forward and commit crimes openly.\n\nIt is critical to consider the complexity of America’s gun violence epidemic. Although mass shooters target innocent civilians at large, people kill in self-defense; they also commit suicide using weapons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2020, 54% of all gun-related deaths in the US were suicides (24,292). Therefore, gun violence should never be equated to mass shootings alone. The issue is more nuanced than we think.\n\nTake for instance the Covid-19 pandemic. It caused 45,000 deaths (suicide or homicide) by guns. These deaths can be partly attributed to loss of jobs, psychological strain and exacerbated mental illness that Americans experienced in 2020.\n\nThat said, gun violence in America continues to take an emotional toll on families, while gun advocates observe in silence. Gun advocacy is a big part of the problem to push for safer, smarter gun control measures. A vocal proponent of guns is Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who signed seven laws, making it easier for people to access guns, including individuals over 21 who can carry a handgun without license and training. Easier access to guns caused gun violence to soar in Texas, which has one of the highest numbers of mass shootings in the US. Last year, Texas saw a 65% increase in mass shootings.\n\nOn top of gun advocates and GOP (republican party) members backing their second amendment rights, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has an equally important role to play in politicising gun control. It is no surprise that the NRA uses funds to push its agenda forward, which is to support guns left-right-centre. They use heaps of money to sway the debate surrounding gun control in their favour. Numerous Republicans⁠, Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, Mitch McConnell, and a dozen others have benefited from the NRA in the past, including a law firm that has backed the association for years in exchange of $23 million.\n\nIn the wake of deadly mass shootings, it is unfathomable that the NRA would hold its annual meeting days after the Robb Elementary School massacre. This insensitive move demonstrates the NRA’s audacity to push for gun rights in a time when thousands of families grieve the loss of their loved ones. The association claims that it is “committed to making schools secure” but it is only in the guise of hypocrisy.\n\nAlthough democrat states including New York and California are making concerted efforts to counter gun violence through bills and gun buyback programs, these efforts will never budge GOP members. Schools, colleges, theaters and bars will continue to be targets of mass shootings because second amendment rights hold more value than human life in Republican states.\n\nSo, where is the middle ground if there is no solution to gun control at all? The key is to keep gun laws intact but changing the eligibility criteria of who qualifies to own a gun. A person with a history of mental illness should never have access to guns. This begs the question: how do you know someone is mentally unfit to own a gun? That is where running thorough background checks comes into play. These background checks can help curb a potential mass shooter from committing mass murder.\n\nIn addition, the legal age to own a gun should be raised from 18 years to at least 21. Right now, individuals 18 and older can be sold long guns, which is alarming given that two 18 year-olds were responsible for the deadliest school shootings in America (Sandy Hook and the recent Robb Elementary School shootings). Countries such as Norway, Canada, New Zealand and Australia managed to curb gun violence through smart gun laws. The rate of mass shootings has sharply declined in these countries. Perhaps the US should extract valuable lessons and parallel similar gun reform strategies, if not exactly the same.\n\nThe media plays a very essential role to get the word about gun control out to the public. If media agencies including digital, print and broadcast, set aside their political differences and harmonise to address gun violence and gun control, things can steer in the right direction. Media coverage of mass shootings across the country can raise more alarm about gun violence in America, which can lead to protests, political pressure and ultimately, some form of resolution.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/OHKOJWUK2FLT7FEKYXS47ABT3I1653551321-0/OHKOJWUK2FLT7FEKYXS47ABT3I1653551321-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Why developing countries should not reduce their reliance on fossil fuels", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97593/why-developing-countries-should-not-reduce-their-reliance-on-fossil-fuels", "date_published": "Fri, 03 Jun 22 09:57:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn just 24 days in 2022, an average American had produced more carbon than an average Pakistani would produce in the whole year. In just three days, an average Australian emits more carbon dioxide than his counterpart would do in the whole year in Niger. The video gaming industry in the United States (US) consumes more electricity than any country in Africa. Of the total 1.5 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere since the middle of the 18th century, 70 per cent has been produced by the US, China, Europe and Russia, with the US being the largest emitter by far. \n\nThese are some of the facts that reflect a wide gap between posturing by the rich countries of the world of being considerate of the environment and the deplorable ground reality.\n\nThe richest countries are home to half of the world’s population and emit 86 per cent of the world’s total carbon dioxide emissions. If we are to improve the climate and limit global heating to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, carbon emissions have to be curbed and more action is required from the rich and developed countries. Many in the developing world are of the opinion that the global north has already benefited from fossil fuels and now that it has all the means and resources to shift to cleaner energy, it is imposing the same on the global south where people are yet to attain a higher standard of living. Critical energy projects for less economically developed countries are being banned under the garb of environmental conservation.\n\nAt the 26th Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) held in 2021, more than 20 countries – including the US and some European nations – pledged to stop foreign fossil fuel financing while giving no indication of curbing their domestic production and expansion. Such two-faced actions do more harm than good: one, by pushing poor countries further to the brink; and two, by making a mockery of environmentalism and snatching away its true spirit and purpose.\n\nIn a similar move, China announced last year that it won’t build new coal-fired power plants abroad. China has been the major contributor to Pakistan’s coal-powered energy sector in the recent past. Pakistan has total coal reserves of more than 185 billion tonnes and ranks seventh among the countries with the largest lignite coal reserves. These reserves can ensure sustainable development by keeping the economic and social pillars of sustainability intact through empowerment, improved well-being and availability of opportunities for the present and future generations.\n\nDepriving the developing world of growth and development by curbing the supply of fossil fuels or by halting investments in fossil-generated energy projects will deteriorate beleaguered economies. It is important that the global south be allowed to follow the same path to development as the global north took, that is, by ensuring development through industrialisation, even if it came through the use of fossil fuels. Economic prosperity will, in fact, enable the availability of necessary resources and capital to protect another pillar of sustainability – the environment. This doesn’t mean that development will necessarily come at the expense of the environment. Environmentally-friendly fuel to energy conversion technologies can be used to mitigate harmful environmental impacts. Instead of curbing the funding of fossil-generated energy projects, the richer countries should invest in the use of less harmful methods of energy generation through fossil fuels.\n\nReadily available and economically viable energy options are the need of the hour for many developing countries like Pakistan, without which the achievement of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will remain a distant dream.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1080201-SmokestackinChinaCarbonemissionsAFPxx-1459978271/1080201-SmokestackinChinaCarbonemissionsAFPxx-1459978271.jpg"}, {"headline": "It’s not about being pro-abortion, it’s about being pro-choice", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97578/its-not-about-being-pro-abortion-its-about-being-pro-choice", "date_published": "Sat, 07 May 22 10:24:08 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSome interesting developments (or lack thereof) have surfaced about the abortion laws in the United States (US). Feminists who fought long and hard for a woman’s right to choose are turning in their graves after discovering that Justice Samuel Alito is considering overturning a landmark decision in the case of Roe v Wade, which sought to protect abortion rights in the US almost 50 years ago. An initial draft of the said move has been leaked. Even though this leaked draft is not the final verdict or opinion of the court, it has however sparked a serious wave of reactions and disappointment from abortion rights advocates. If the final call reflects the opinion draft, America will see a drastic shift regarding abortion rights in the country.\n\nFor anyone not already familiar with the original Roe v Wade, here is a quick description and a somewhat lengthy explanation about its significance for women’s rights. A landmark decision was taken in 1973 by the US Supreme Court that ruled that the Constitution of the US protected women’s liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restrictions. This decision ultimately opened up safe spaces and clinics for women who wished to have abortions done, with services provided by fully trained and licensed physicians. The decision ultimately explained that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution provides “a right to privacy” which protects a pregnant woman’s rights to choose. Furthermore, the court reasoned those outlawing abortions would violate a pregnant woman’s right to privacy for reasons such as:\n\n\n\thaving unwanted children would lead to a distressful life and future for the woman;\n\tit may cause long-term psychological harm which could result in poor care of the child considering the mother’s weak physical and mental health;\n\tand because there may be “distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child”.\n\n\nThe decision was celebrated by abortion rights advocates as this was a huge move towards recognising women’s rights when it came to making their own choices about their bodies. And why shouldn’t it be? The benefits of legalised abortion are plentiful – fewer illegitimate births, smaller welfare costs, less children born as a result of rape. However, according to Alito, the constitution makes no such reference to abortion and that no such right is implicitly protected by the constitutional provision.\n\nTherefore, the overturning of Roe v Wade would lead to stricter limits on abortion access largely in the South and Midwest, with about half of the states set to immediately enforce broad abortion bans. On the other hand, the following 16 states have laws in place to protect the right to abortion: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\n\nWhy this debate is causing such an uproar is not only because this is overall a huge setback for women’s right to choose what they want to do with their bodies but also the deep negative impact the ban will have (if implemented) on women who are prevented from obtaining abortions. Some of these adverse consequences include mental, physical and financial impacts. It has been proven in several studies that being denied an abortion is linked with an increase in anxiety, stress and lower self-esteem shortly after the denial. Women who are denied abortions also experience financial hardship, including an increase in household poverty considering there are additional mouths to feed and there are no strict laws around having the biological father provide child care support.\n\nIf abortion is to be banned and women’s bodies are to be controlled by a bunch of old white men, then perhaps they should also consider the consequences this will have on those very women, especially rape victims who have to carry the child of their abuser for nine months and then live with that trauma forever; while also being at risk of being contacted by the rapist for child custody or continued sexual violence and harassment. The ban would also greatly impact teenage mothers, sex workers and/or those women who become pregnant in cases of premarital and extramarital affairs. The fear of raising the child alone and being financially incapable of raising the child are of the top most reasons of pregnancy termination. Another very common reason for terminating a pregnancy is known as “young age pregnancy”, which ultimately would affect the young girl’s life negatively, while restricting her mobility and opportunities. Why is it that controlling women’s bodies and hindering their bodily autonomy is always up for debate, yet men’s accountability is hardly ever spoken about?\n\nA better draft opinion to read about would’ve been the US Supreme Court leaning towards providing free vasectomies for men. It’s a fairly painless and reversible process which does not cause any kind of long-term psychological or physical ailments. If men who get women pregnant can ‘choose’ not be part of the raising process, they should be encouraged to undergo the medical procedure so as to not cause pregnancies at all. The procedure can be reversed if and when they decide to have children consensually with their partner. But of course, restricting men’s bodily autonomy would be of the utmost disgrace and disrespect.\n\nAccording to Alito’s draft opinion, the idea that the abortion bans reflect the subjugation of women in American society is wrong considering women still have electoral and political power. By this logic, if women possess the right to vote or hold a public position, they should completely give up the right to decide what they want to do with their bodies because a few people who don’t even have a uterus can feel important about themselves. I wonder if these people who have decided to put these rights up for debates in the first place have even researched about the topic at all. It is actually quite obvious that despite the bans on abortions, they will continue to take place, only they will be unsafe and painful ones. Post-abortion care is essential for addressing disabilities caused by induced or self-induced abortions because they can surely be taken care of. However, the likelihood of women having access to post-abortion care and services will be practically zero in the states where the ban is to be implemented.\n\nThe US claims to be a superpower leading the world with its impeccable score on all fronts as a nation, but ironically their conservative ideas around minority rights have always remained questionable. These abortion laws are no different. Abortion is a reality, which is why it is essential that women be provided with affordable and easily accessible services without any pre-conceived notions and biases. The right to choose is a fundamental one and courts should challenge their abortion laws instead of executing bans that are only an attack on women’s freedom. If there is a ban which needs to be implemented immediately it is America’s gun laws which take more lives than abortions, with conviction rates of criminals at a disappointingly low rate, especially if the shooter is described as a white male. Pro-life advocates who are for the ban need to rethink their priorities and direct their energy into making more sensible arguments and fight for the justice of innocent children and adults who have been killed during school hours or in movie theatres by white American men who have the freedom to legally obtain a weapon over the counter, that too without a license or any understandable reason.\n\nThis is not about being pro-abortion, this is about being pro-choice, that no matter what your personal feelings or beliefs about abortion are, you understand it is not your place to make a decision for another woman about what she can and cannot do with her body.\n\nTo know where Pakistan stands on abortion laws, you can read my detailed piece here.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651920521-0/Cover1651920521-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Follow Riasat-e-Medina in Pakistan but not in Medina itself", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97576/follow-riasat-e-medina-in-pakistan-but-not-in-medina-itself", "date_published": "Sat, 30 Apr 22 10:01:34 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tYou know things have truly gone down the drain when local politics in Pakistan is unnecessarily taken out of context, literally, and used as a sorry excuse to spread hatred, ignorance, violence and blatant sexism. In the most recent case of embarrassing and shameful events, supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) went ahead and created complete havoc at Masjid-e-Nabawi without thinking twice about the historical and religious importance of the very ground they stood on.\n\nIn case they forgot, here is a quick reminder: Masjid-e-Nabawi is one of the most sacred places in Medina for Muslims. Considering Pakistanis have self-appointed themselves as the sole protectors of Islam for so long by protecting and defending blasphemy laws in the hope of punishing (even if wrongly) those who apparently disrespect Islam, this very act in Medina has proved that nothing – not even a place of worship during one of the holiest months for Muslims – can stop these devils from showing their true colours.\n\nThere is a nasty video being circulated on social media showing a bunch of men chanting slogans of “chor, chor” (thieves) at some members of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s delegation in Medina. Not only that, it is clearly visible and audible the highly disrespectful and profane language and slogans being hurled at the current Federal Minister of Information and Broadcasting Maryam Aurangzeb. Using disrespectful and disconcerting sexist slogans against women is so outdated but, since a patriarchal induced understanding of gender and culture plagues this country so deeply, this is hardly a surprise. Degrading and violating women has long been used as a tool and indicator of victory in wars, and this, it seems, is no different – especially since Imran Khan keeps comparing this whole political escapade to the battle of Karbala.\n\nThe harassment faced by various members of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) while performing their religious duties has raised eyebrows across the globe as Pakistanis are yet again being highlighted for their deranged actions. The sanctity of the holy mosque has been spoiled and there is no justification for carrying out dirty political agendas on holy sites.\n\nAs if the political garbage that we’re witnessing first-hand in Pakistan wasn’t enough, we are now a mere laughing spectacle for those nations whom we have tried to convince otherwise in the hopes of building amicable relations. As if our perceived association with terrorism wasn’t enough, this has added another feather to our embarrassment cap. If Imran set out to create a Riasat-e-Medina in Pakistan, perhaps he should give sermons to his followers on how to effectively follow the rules of Medina in Medina at the very least. It’s obvious that pre-planning this stunt did not go the way he wished. Sadly, and evidently, this cult mentality has brought politically blinded citizens to a point where they see nothing wrong with what they did. Many have not even bothered to condemn this awful incident, and the rest are still finding ways to justify it.\n\nYes, every citizen of a country should be well-aware and critical of the politics of their country and should be able to question their leaders whenever they see irregularities, injustices and/or discrimination taking place. But to be politically charged to this extent is very dangerous since some Pakistanis will export their violent and extremist attitudes to the countries which have allowed them in, further causing global isolation. These actions are mostly perpetuated by men, and usually women have to pay the price. But alas, when a so-called leader openly supports sexual harassers and believes in victim-shaming, one can hardly expect any wise, well-thought out and grounded decision-making.\n\nI am amazed at how effortlessly all of this has been planned and implemented. This particular incident reeks of misogyny and hypocrisy at all levels. It is obvious that this will destabilise and polarise the nation further, and will make violence an acceptable form of ‘protest’. The common saying “politics can be dirty” is an understatement in the case of Pakistan. Our politics is not only ours, it’s for the entire world to find entertainment in. But, more importantly, it is a disgrace to the religion we hold so dear.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651313943-0/Cover1651313943-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Are we on the brink of a global recession?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97575/are-we-on-the-brink-of-a-global-recession", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Apr 22 08:21:09 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSince Covid-19 brought the world to a halt in 2020, life has been nothing short of a nightmare.

However, with the introduction of vaccinations, we assumed the horror was finally over, but nothing could be farther from the truth. With inflation on the rise, widespread supply chain bottlenecks, and rising geopolitical tensions, governments face a monumental task in steering their countries away from a crisis. Looking at the current global situation, it is clear that we are in deep waters and may be on the verge of a global recession.\n\nWith economies all over the world reopening and consumers returning to markets, the main issue that central banks are dealing with is rising consumer prices. To combat inflation from rising any further, central banks started winding down their quantitative easing measures put in place at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, these measures were rendered ineffective due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which exacerbated global supply chains and drove commodity prices to historic highs, adding fuel to the already raging fire.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict has been detrimental to oil and gas prices, which have risen sharply. Furthermore, the two countries are large exporters of agricultural commodities, and account for nearly 14% of global wheat trade. Similarly, Russia and Ukraine account for nearly 19% of global barley exports and nearly 52% of global sunflower oil exports.\n\nIt is also important to note that, because Russia is a major fertiliser exporter, sanctions against the country could have a negative impact on fertiliser supply around the world, lowering crop yields. Russia is also a major supplier of valuable minerals such as palladium, titanium, nickel, and neon. Palladium, in particular, is a critical component in automobile manufacturing, and its price has increased astronomically since the war began. Supply disruptions in these commodities from Russia and Ukraine have driven up consumer prices even further.\n\nAside from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, China’s zero-Covid policy is causing mayhem in commodity supplies all over the world. The imposition of strict lockdowns and travel restrictions is harming demand and economic growth in the world's second-largest economy. Shanghai, the world’s busiest container port, is closed due to an uptick in coronavirus infections in the region. As a result, hundreds of cargo ships have been stranded in the port.\n\nMoving forward, China's return to a Covid-zero state is highly unlikely given the likelihood of new coronavirus variants emerging in the future. As a result, the global economy is predicted to stay under pressure, at least in the short term, and inflation is expected to continue its upward trend, forcing central banks to continue hiking interest rates until the global macroeconomic outlook stabilises.\n\nConsequently, given the Russia-Ukraine war and the slowing down of China’s economy, policymakers around the world are considering the likelihood of the global economy entering into a recession. According to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the growth of the global economy will drop to 2.8% in 2022. Earlier, it had predicted that the global economy would expand by nearly 4.1% before Russia declared war on Ukraine. Similarly, as per WoodMac, a research and consultancy company, the global economy is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2022 and 0.7% in 2023.\n\nInvestors around the world are already tweaking their strategies and becoming more cautious as uncertainty in global markets continues to rise. This is clear from the inversion of the American Treasury yield curve, which indicates that investors are shifting away from risky equities and towards short-term fixed income bonds in an attempt to protect themselves from the possibility of the global economy slowing down in the short term. Furthermore, fund managers around the world are also increasing the weightage of cash in their portfolios.\n\nConsidering the aforementioned warning signs such as rising inflation, inversion of the American treasury yield curve, and portfolio reallocation by global fund managers, the likelihood of the global economy entering a recession in the short term is high. Hence, countries are at a critical juncture where policymakers must be proactive in dealing with the looming issues, and governments should be actively seeking for ways to protect their respective countries from the implications of a global recession.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651134728-0/Cover1651134728-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "From India to Bharat", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97566/from-india-to-bharat", "date_published": "Wed, 06 Apr 22 10:18:47 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIf centuries of plunder in the subcontinent, communal rifts and destructive power struggles were someone’s fault, whose were they? Were they ours? Was it theirs? I’m still searching for the answers but what I do know is that our past divided us then and it continues to divide us now. The fact that Narendra Modi’s India is a polarised state practicing blatant discrimination of minority communal groups and economic classes isn’t news. Modi’s rise to power isn’t an anomaly; it isn’t just a chapter in India’s history – it's a carefully crafted manifestation of an ideology. \n\nHave you ever wondered how and why Jawaharlal Nehru’s “azaad” India has embarked on such a journey? How and why is the very nature of the world’s largest democracy being rebuilt? Is it really that bad?\n\nHindutva: who is a Hindu?\n\nWith the arrival of European missionaries in India, the practice of proselytism not only threatened the socio-religious structure of society, it also brought changes in its demography. To resist the new faith, Hindu reformers endowed their religion with egalitarian values through a reinterpretation of the – highly abstract in nature – Vedas. This led to the creation of a golden age of Hinduism which was then supported by movements such as the Arya Samaj. The 1919 mobilisation of Indian Muslims in support of the Caliphate of Constantinople – the Khilafat movement – solidified the “majoritarian inferiority complex” of the Hindus due to its Pan-Islamic nature.\n\nIt was in this context that VD Savarkar codified the Hindu nationalist ideology, citing four factors in determining the eligibility of a “Hindu” – race (Aryan decent and Vedic fathers), territory (Vedic land where the holy rivers flow), language (Sanskrit) and culture. Savarkar also pointed out the similarities between his definition of “who is a Hindu” and the Zionists. MS Golwalkar’s views on the topic went one step ahead. He believed that Muslims of India did not deserve “even citizen rights” in the Hindu state. Their only option was to either submit or leave. These were the narratives which led to the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1925.\n\nTowards BJP\n\nThe organisation which started off by combating communists grew into a tentacular Sangh Parivar over the years with numerous sector-based organisations that gradually saturated the social space. The aim of the Sangh Parivar is state formation, not mere state-building. RSS entered the political arena in the 1950s after Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination by an alleged member of the movement and a close aid of Savarkar. Undoubtedly a dark time in the RSS’s history, the national outrage led to the arrests of 20,000 Swayamsevaks and the outlawing of the organisation which Nehru saw as an “Indian embodiment of fascism”. The Bharatiya Janata Sangh (BJS) was created by Golwalkar in 1951 in response to these developments.\n\nIn the time leading up to Modi’s rule in Gujrat, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, formerly BJS) had garnered considerable support in India, capitalising on its role in the Ayodhya Movement which resulted in violent clashes between the Hindu and Muslim communities during the “Ram Yatra”. Since then, the BJP has emerged as a populist party in India’s ethnic democracy which is against any and all things it deems a threat to the RSS ideology. The BJP’s primary targets are Muslims and Indian secularism. Its more concealed motives include the continued socioeconomic repression of the other backward classes (OBCs) and the scheduled castes (SCs), together with a complete dismantling of the very ethos of India’s once renowned impartial institutions.\n\nA lesson in populism \n\nIf there was ever a book titled “populism for dummies”, an account of Modi’s rise to power is sure to make an appearance. A product of the RSS, Modi in a true populist fashion rose to power following the Gujrat riots. During this time, violence was promoted and validated against Muslims, the “other”, by Modi and RSS radicals in response to the Godhra tragedy. Communal differences were then exacerbated to a point of no return, and it is from here that Modi’s populism turned into national populism. His humble beginnings helped him connect with the masses on an unprecedented scale and his shrewdness coupled with charisma propelled him into the status of an “ideal”. He was at once borne out of a mythology yet remained rooted in reality.\n\nDistancing himself from the Muslims, Modi established himself as an “Emperor of The Hindu Hearts”. His economic policies accelerated the growth rate in Gujrat – albeit at the expense of the proletariat – which would later lead him to tout the “Gujrat Model” in his 2014 election campaign. Subsequently, in the 2000s, when Islamic terrorism was at its peak, Modi would find himself at the centre of assassination attempts supposedly sponsored by ‘jihadis’. It did not matter that there was a complete lack of evidence to support the claims that the Pakistani state was behind this supposed threat, or that the ‘jihadis’ arrested were later acquitted by the Indian courts. He had established his national populist repertoire – a feat which would get him elected as the prime minister for two consecutive terms.\n\nThe first term \n\nDuring his first term, Modi focused on raising the “self-esteem” and “dignity” of the Indian people by introducing programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jan-Dhan Yojana, and Ujjwala Yojana. While there were no concrete reforms to help raise the economic status of his newly created “neo-middle class” or the poor, he also scaled back on the previously launched pro-poor programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Modi’s urban consumer bias was apparent in the economic policies put forth which facilitated crony capitalism. He diverted the people’s attention by focusing on social justice and keeping communal violence brewing to appease his “angry young men” who had taken the law into their own hands primarily through vigilantism (The Bajrang Dal).\n\nThis constant cycle of fear of the “Other” converting into anger was apparent in the activities of the Gau Rakshak Dal. Moreover, campaigns against ‘love jihad’ and ‘land jihad’ further unveiled the anti-Muslim sentiments of not only the state but Indian society as well. In the larger scheme of things, Modi’s politics led to the banalisation of Hindutva, reformation of the education system in line with the RSS ideology, crackdown on secularists and free press, ‘reconversion’ campaigns, opening up the state apparatus to the RSS, and deterioration of India’s once revered institutions including the police, Supreme Court, media, and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\n\nModi 2.0\n\nBy the 2019 elections, India had already converted into a “De-Facto Hindu Rashtra”. Staying true to his saintly politics, Modi centered his campaign on an “external enemy” – Pakistan. The Balakot strikes following the Pulwama attack, together with Pakistan’s goodwill gesture of Wing Commander Abhinandan’s release were hailed as ‘victories’ in India. Interestingly, Bharat, by then, had embarked on a path towards electoral authoritarianism, thus the main opposition parties barely stood a chance.\n\nCapitalising off caste politics and plebian support for the “strong man”, the BJP, with the conquest of the Rajya Sabha, was now in a position to fulfill its primary objectives – the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the abrogation of Article 370. The Ayodhya verdict was the final nail in India’s secular identity. Christophe Jaffrelot thereby concludes that India is now an ethnic democracy wherein the Hindus are bound by racial, linguistic, religious or other such cultural characteristics. Their strong sense of identity is pivotal for the rejection of the “other” which isn’t protected by the government nor the international community.\n\nThe greatest divide \n\nIn a democratic structure, regardless of the adjectives, claiming to be ‘apolitical’ is perhaps the highest tier of ignorance. If democracy is a government by the people, for the people, and from the people, how can the two ever be separated? Of course, outliers do exist, but when a feat is present in majority, it becomes the norm. BJP’s anti-Muslim bias, RSS’s Hindutva ideology, and Modi’s populist politics exist and thrive in India, for the Indian people, by the Indian citizens, from the Indian society. India’s polarisation was triggered by deep-seated insecurities, and with multiple fears and numerous threats – real or fake – assimilation becomes the best course of action. While there is beauty in diversity, there is security in homogenisation. It looks like the people of India have chosen their rulers. Where this majoritarian rule leads Bharat will unravel a new chapter in the history of war itself – the Greatest Divide is yet to come.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1649243028-0/Cover1649243028-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "What should be on the OIC’s agenda?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97560/what-should-be-on-the-oics-agenda", "date_published": "Tue, 22 Mar 22 11:13:05 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) signed a charter in 1969 aiming for peace, solidarity and mutual economic development. One premium objective of the charter is the commitment of the states to following ‘International Law.’ The charter also profoundly adopts the fundamental freedoms, human rights and good governance for development as the core of the international policy system and organisational structure. Although criticised, another landmark development under the OIC system was the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, which complements the Declaration on Human Rights and other United Nations (UN) human rights instruments.\n\nFurthermore, the Astana Declaration as policy guidance for investment in science, technology, education and development is significant for the effective implementation of sustainable development goals or the development agenda of 2030. As the OIC is the second largest intergovernmental organisation after the UN, it was expected that it would be safeguarding Muslim rights and interests in the global policy system.\n\nHowever, the charter governing the 1.8 billion in the contemporary era of globalisation is still seeking an effective implementation plan because most of the developing and underdeveloped Muslim states are equipped with poor governance and mismanaged structures. The objectivity of the OIC in the developmental agenda counters the hegemony and individualistic approaches. As members of the OIC are currently meeting in Islamabad, it is worth considering what the OIC should aim to achieve over the coming years.\n\nThe member states of the OIC implemented non-interference in their internal matters and pursued secular interests over the developmental agenda. The war among a few Muslim States is one example. Foreign intervention is another. This simultaneously indicated in the past that Muslim states’ inter-relations in sub-systems cannot be translated into one big policy umbrella. The given issues also highlight the apparent reasons for not having any meaningful Muslim representation in the global policy system.\n\nThe pertinent question now is how the OIC, as the key representing the authority of Muslim states, can be effective in the global policy system. OIC theoretically attempted to portray itself as an organisation that upholds the ‘global Islamic agenda’, and that it is somehow similar to the UN instruments reflecting human rights, peace and sustainable development. To implement the human rights agenda effectively, the OIC must think about an organisational structure that may monitor and report to the authorities. There could be a multilateral court of justice following the regional judicial systems of Europe, Africa and South America.\n\nMore legitimisation of the OIC through establishing a meaningful ‘executive’ under the sub-state system shall present a robust approach towards implementing the local agenda of 2030. The OIC may also think about more sub-committees or sub-groups on diverse but common development policy programmes.\n\nAlthough it seems that the OIC has a limited role in the effective implementation of the agenda of Muslim states, the OIC may rethink how the local implementation of global agendas can help its voice in the global policy system. The OIC can bring together the states and people for common issues such as climate change, poverty eradication, human development and environmentalism.\n\nWhat is more prominent is that the initial establishment of the OIC emphasised the ‘Ummah,’ which may encompass the Muslim representation worldwide and welcome integration of other states with the Muslim population. More importantly, the affiliation in the OIC system as a non-observer state can be closely linked to present challenges of corruption, poor governance, unsustainable development, climate change and environmental crises.\n\nIt is undeniable that financial assistance is the only way forward for such agendas, and for such purposes, more extensive integration in the OIC of developed states cannot be avoided. So far, the challenges of inequitable growth and development are not addressed by the international policy systems and are unlikely to be resolved. The UN 2030 agenda has already suggested regional and sub-regional integration for common goals towards more considerable cooperation.\n\nIf the OIC is seeking an influential role in the sustainable development agenda of 2030, it should reframe its existing governance mechanism. The recognition of the future development agenda as suggested by the UN shall be recognised by the OIC and shall address the 17 primary goals for human development in the Muslim states. In doing so, the OIC must reconsider the assistance of policy experts, academia, social scientists, stakeholders and specific-area experts. Such initiatives will provide the OIC with valuable global representation.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1647948826-0/Cover1647948826-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "India’s institutionalised prejudice against Islamophobia", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97557/indias-institutionalised-prejudice-against-islamophobia", "date_published": "Fri, 18 Mar 22 10:35:30 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIndia recently called out the United Nations (UN) resolution which declares May 15th as the International Day to combat Islamophobia. TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, expressed concern that an emphasis on one religion takes away attention from the phobias against Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism. He states that India had offered sanctuary to Zoroastrians, Jews and others in the spirit of pluralism and expressed concern regarding the attack on gurudwaras (Sikh temples), the destruction of Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, and the glorification of the breaking of idols. Tirumurti further said he instead preferred the generic term religion-phobia to combat hatred against all religions.\n\nSuch a position was to be expected from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) India, which is bent on ‘decolonising’ the influence of past Muslim invaders by furthering the dharmic faiths (Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism) at the expense of demonising present-day Muslims and Islam. The fact that the ruling party remains strategically quiet when calls for genocide of Muslims are made is a testament to this observation. Scores of Hindutva trolls are usually out and about on Pakistani and other social media sites where they demonise Muslims and perpetuate their victimhood despite being an overwhelming majority in India. It is against this backdrop that the Indian representative brazenly projected his country’s institutionalised prejudice.\n\nHowever, Tirumurti conveniently failed to recognise and mention the systemic genocide of the Rohingya Muslims by Buddhists in Myanmar, the concentration camps of Uighurs in China, the mass destruction of Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq in a post 9/11 world that has led to the universal singling out of Muslims and Islam. He ignored the fact that two billion Muslims are often generalised and stereotyped as terrorists and that many Sikhs in the West are targeted not because of their Sikhism but because they are perceived as Muslims. In other words, the targeting of people of colour and Sikhs in the West is also because of Islamophobia.\n\nIt is true that Hindu girls face forced conversion in the Sindh province of Pakistan, but this oppression is unique to that province (based on feudalism) and is not found in Arab countries. Similarly, the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was perpetrated by the rogue Taliban and not other Afghans who have enjoyed good relations with India. In fact, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has recently facilitated the construction of a large Hindu temple as well. The same goes for Pakistan that unilaterally took steps to facilitate Sikh pilgrims to their holy sites in Pakistan. If anything, it was the Indian government that took draconian steps against Sikhs and the Golden Temple in the mid-80s.\n\nThe Indian representative mentioned the glorification of the breaking of idols, which is reminiscent of the past Muslim invaders from central Asia in the age of empires. However, those Muslim invaders from Persia, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and other central Asian places are long dead. It was a different time where human rights violations were perpetrated by anyone and everyone. The sacking of Baghdad by the Mongols is one such example. However, the BJP and its leader Narendra Modi seem fixated on the past and not on the present where their government has singled out and marginalised Muslims through the Citizenship Act.\n\nThe whatbaoutism of the Indian state in an attempt to deflect attention away from Islamophobia towards “religion-phobia” is clear for everyone to see. The words of Tirumurti remind us of those white supremacists who argue against “Black Lives Matter” by responding with “All Lives Matter”, or of those homophobes who argue against the Pride Parade by resorting to the inanities of “what about Straight Parade”.\n\nIt is time India stops comparing itself to Pakistan, which itself has huge issues of intolerance, and starts addressing its internal issues of the systemic discrimination and Hindutva calls for genocide of their own Muslim minorities.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1647603749-0/Cover1647603749-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistani migrants bounce back", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2370889/pakistani-migrants-bounce-back", "date_published": "Fri, 12 Aug 22 20:47:25 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe number of Pakistani nationals migrating for work mostly to the Gulf countries has bounced back to the pre-Covid-19 level to around 65,000 per month in January 2022 in the wake of rising income of oil exporting Arab countries and advanced economies around the world.\n\n“The monthly flow of Pakistani workers (abroad) has reverted to pre-Covid levels,” the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in its half-yearly report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for July-December of fiscal year 2021-22 released on Friday.\n\nOver 70% of Pakistani workers go to GCC countries mostly to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nThe number of migrating Pakistani workers plunged to zero during the initial five months of the pandemic – April-August 2020, according to the central bank’s report.\n\nThe normalisation of the flow of workers to foreign countries along with a surge in the income of oil exporting GCC countries indicates the inflow of workers’ remittances to Pakistan will remain steady at around “$32 billion in the current fiscal year 2023 compared to $31 billion in FY22”, Topline Research projected last week.\n\nAs many as 458,257 Pakistanis proceeded abroad for employment in the first seven months (January-July) of 2022.

It was January 2020 when around 65,000 Pakistani went abroad for job purposes last time before the outbreak of the virus in Pakistan in February 2020.\n\nThe central bank’s report said no word on the economic outlook for the current fiscal year 2023, as it usually does in its quarterly, half-yearly and annual reports. Instead, it gave an outdated outlook for the second half (January-June) of FY22.\n\nTo recall, the country achieved economic growth of 6% for the second consecutive fiscal year in 2021-22.\n\nThe central bank said in its latest State of Pakistan’s Economy report that the collection of revenue in taxes to the government increased notably, but mostly due to increased imports during the first half of the previous fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. \n\nFederal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) collection of revenue in taxes increased by 32% in the first half of FY22, notwithstanding somewhat slower growth in the second quarter (Oct-Dec FY22), as economic activities improved and general price levels rose as compared to last year.\n\n“However, most of this increase stemmed from import-related taxes, on account of the broad-based increase in import volumes, international commodity prices, and PKR (Pakistani rupee) depreciation,” SBP said in the report.\n\nThe government, however, sharply cut imports in the first month (July) of the current fiscal year 2022 to $4.9 billion to avert the risk of default on international payments ahead of the resumption of IMF’s extended $7 billion loan programme in last week of the current month of August 2022.\n\nThe imports had hit a five-month high at $2.3 billion in June.\n\nFinance Minister Miftah Ismail said the other day the curb on imports would remain in place over the next three to four-month to improve the country’s capacity to make import payments and foreign debt 946,571 repayments.\n\nThe import curtailment may compromise FBR collection of revenue in taxes in the three to fourth-month of low imports in FY23.\n\nFrom the perspective of the first half of FY22, the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) exhibited broad-based expansion, exports grew buoyant alongside growth in FBR taxes and Kharif crops recorded higher production, the central bank said.\n\nHowever, amid multi-year high global commodity prices, rising inflation and current account deficit posed a challenge as the year progressed, it said.\n\n“These pressures necessitated monetary tightening amidst other regulatory measures to moderate demand.”­­\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 13th, 2022.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/41660337318-0/41660337318-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Senate panel seeks details of PIA pilots", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2310861/senate-panel-seeks-details-of-pia-pilots", "date_published": "Fri, 16 Jul 21 06:16:48 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Senate Standing Committee on Aviation on Thursday sought details of the pilots working with the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and was briefed on the functions of the Aviation Division and its attached departments.\n\nThe committee meeting, chaired by Hidayatullah, reviewed working procedures, budget, number of employees, challenges faced by the Aviation Division and its subsidiaries and the performance of the institutions.\n\nAmong others, the meeting was attended by senators Syed Muhammad Sabir Shah, Faisal Saleem Rehman, Mian Raza Rabbani, Aun Abbas, Faisal Javed, Saleem Mandviwalla, Afnanullah Khan, Dilawar Khan and Sherry Rehman, besides Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Aviation Secretary Ali, Adviser to CEO PIA Amir Hayat, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Director General Flight Lieutenant (retd) Khaqan Murtaza, Airport Security Force chief security officer, Pakistan Meteorological Department director general and other senior officials.\n\nIt also looked into the measures taken by the Aviation Division to improve performance of the attached departments and its future plans to tackle challenges confronted on the professional front.\n\nIt was the committee's first meeting after its reconstitution followed by the Senate elections.\nHidayatullah said the committee proceedings would be made more effective with mutual consultation of the members so that the confronted issues could be removed in an efficient manner.

Kamran Ghulam\n\nKamran Ghulam may not be a household name yet since he hasn’t represented Pakistan national team till now, but people who follow domestic cricket closely know him as the next big thing.\n\nThe right-handed batsman, in the recently concluded Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, bettered the record for most runs in a single QeA Trophy season. The record, earlier held by Saadat Ali with 1217 runs, was broken by Ghulam in the final of the tournament where he was representing Khyber-Pakhtukhwa.\n\nHowever, this is not the only thing that pushed Wasim to include the 25-year-old in the squad.\n\nGhulam boasts a first-class average of over 53 with 31 matches to his name. He has scored nine 100s and 11 fifties to amass 2,413 runs, with a highest score of 166.\n\nIf he can build on his current domestic form when playing against South Africa, the visitors will find it hard to beat Pakistan in the two-Test series.\n\n2. Tabish Khan\n\nIf you’re a pacer outside Pakistan, you’ll probably start your career in mid or late-twenties and end it after your mid-thirties. However, right-arm medium pacer Tabish Khan will start his international career at 36.\n\nSome may say he was not international material, but with 598 wickets in 137 first-class matches, there is and there never was a valid reason to keep him out of the national fray. Well, he’s not the only one who had to wait a long time to get his chance, Fawad Alam is another case study in this regard too.\n\nThere is light at the end of every tunnel and Tabish had to travel miles to find his light and he would love to grab the chance with both hands when he bowls to the South Africans in Karachi and Rawalpindi in the two Tests.\n\nJury is out on whether he will be able to live up to the hype after spending his heydays in the domestic wilderness, but if Tabish wants to question a system which gives multiple chances to a few and nearly zero to some, he will have to utilise all the experience he has gained and get his first and maybe final hurrah on the international level.\n\n3. Saud Shakeel\n\nAnother youngster, with heaps of runs behind him and a first-class average of nearly 49, Saud Shakeel will don the greens of Pakistan during the two Tests against South Africa.\n\nAt the age 25, Shakeel has 3220 runs in his books in 46 first-class outings. He also has 10 tons and 17 fifties to boast about and if this is not enough, he can bowl left-arm slow.\n\nShakeel has come to the fore through the Pakistan cricket ranks and has played for the U19 team, which may prove to be a point in his favour as he had the grooming of a cricketer from an early age.\n\nAll in all, Pakistan have played a big gamble by benching their usual suspects and giving the domestic performers a chance to shine. This move may turn new chief selector Wasim into a hero that many were waiting for, however it can backfire too.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Kamran-Ghulam-PCB1611139704-0/Kamran-Ghulam-PCB1611139704-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "4 players who can help Pakistan beat New Zealand in third T20I", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2276840/4-players-who-can-help-pakistan-beat-new-zealand-in-third-t20i", "date_published": "Mon, 21 Dec 20 09:53:42 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan are against the ropes in the three-match T20I series against New Zealand as they’ve lost the opening two games and only a win in third shortest-format game can help them gain much-needed confidence when going into the Tests.\n\nPakistan stayed rigid in their approach and played the same elevens in the first two T20Is, but with the series already lost, it is high time Pakistan try something new on the field against New Zealand.\n\nWhile the option of chasing may present itself if Pakistan win the toss third time on the trot, a few changes in the eleven can also be beneficial for the stand-in captain Shadab Khan.\n\nHere are the three players who can walk in and help Pakistan win the third T20I against New Zealand.\n\n1. Sarfaraz Ahmed\n\nIf you ask a Pakistani cricket fan why Sarfaraz Ahmed was sent into the wilderness, even after taking Pakistan to the summit of the T20I rankings, they would not mention his batting, his wicketkeeping or his captaincy, but they’d rather blame it on him being a Karachi player.\n\nWhether this theory of the Pakistan Cricket Board being biased against Karachi players is true or not, one thing everyone can agree on is that Sarfaraz brings something to the field which many other players can’t – the much-needed energy.\n\nSarfaraz was famous for his animated and chatty wicketkeeping when he was captaining Pakistan in all formats and even though some may disagree, the energy he brought with his shenanigans was contagious.\n\nHim walking to the bowler before and after every delivery, his comments when someone dropped a catch or did a great job in the fielding, all of that is missed with Muhammad Rizwan behind the stumps.\n\nWith Shadab at the helm against a New Zealand side which he is finding very difficult to outwit, an experienced former captain behind the stumps can go a long way in helping Pakistan enforce a win when everything has failed to work.\n\n2 and 3. Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa\n\nWahab Riaz is not doing what he is supposed to do in New Zealand – be the experienced leader of the young bowling pack, and this gives way to Pakistan go for the young but express pace duo of Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa.\n\nInclusion of Musa can also help Shaheen Afridi take a much-needed rest before he is asked to run in and fire on all cylinders during the upcoming Tests.\n\nAlso, if Pakistan really want to make things interesting, they can always replace Haris Rauf with Iftikhar Ahmed. Iftikhar is considered to be a big-hitter, and also can bowl four overs of off-spin. Since New Zealand are perfectly fine when dealing with pacers, a spin of strategy may work in Pakistan’s favour.\n\n4. Usman Qadir\n\nWe all saw what the legendary spinner Abdul Qadir’s son Usman Qadir got from his father – a spin bowling masterclass.\n\nShadab has been off colour in the bowling department in the first two matches, maybe because of his increased focus on batting and recently captaincy and Usman can help fill the shoes of team’s first-choice leggie.\n\nIf there’s a question of who he should replace in the side, anyone between Khushdil Shah and Abdullah Shafique can give way to Usman, as many may still now know that he has the ability to bat quite nicely in the lower order.\n\nPakistan will be concluding their shortest-format series in the third T20I against New Zealand on Tuesday and they will need something new to surprise the hosts and make them submit. However, if they play safe and don’t make any changes, they will surely lose again, with dignity yes, but they will lose.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/comment1608542933-0/comment1608542933-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "3 reasons Pakistan lost first T20I against New Zealand", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2276467/3-reasons-pakistan-lost-first-t20i-against-new-zealand", "date_published": "Fri, 18 Dec 20 12:36:48 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThere was never a doubt that Pakistan would find it difficult to beat New Zealand at the latter’s home and the theory was proven true when the Kiwis beat Men in Green by five wickets in the first T20I of the three-match series on Friday.\n\nWith the defeat, Pakistan will have to pull up their socks for the next two T20Is if they want to salvage the series and win it.\n\nIt was also a sad day for Pakistan stand-in captain Shadab Khan who lost the very first T20I, where he stood as captain.\n\nA closer look of the first T20I shows there were a few things Pakistan could have changed or could have done to prevent the loss in the tour opener.\n\n1. No specialist openers\n\nPakistan won the toss and chose to bat first, but they missed the trick when they asked wicketkeeper-batsman Muhammad Rizwan and newcomer Abdullah Shafique to open the innings against New Zealand.\n\nUnfamiliar with the opening role, Rizwan lost his wicket due to a callous drive and a smart delivery by Jacob Duffy, while Shafique was found out in the second delivery he faced against the Kiwis. Shafique couldn’t fathom the bounce on the pitch and flighted one into the hands of mid-on fielder for an easy catch.\n\nWith the openers gone quickly, as has been the case for Pakistan since eternity, the middle-order, lacking the services of the great Babar Azam, fell like a deck of cards, thus the question of why did Pakistan go with two batsmen upfront who don’t understand the demands of the opener’s role.\n\n2. Batting failure (again)\n\nWith the openers gone, the onus fell on the middle-order to stabilise the innings, but a young Haider Ali was not up to the task. Here, once again, Pakistan did not think twice before sending him at the one-down position, where teams tend to send their best and most in-form batsman.\n\nHaider is all that and a little more, but he lacks the experience of playing at the third spot. However, the next best option to bat at number three, veteran Muhammad Hafeez, did equally bad in batting after being dismissed on the very first ball he faced.\n\nAll thanks to Shadab’s 42 off 32 and a late flurry by Faheem Ashraf, who scored 31 off 18, Pakistan were able to put up a fighting total, but if the top and upper middle-order would have added an extra 20 or 30, the match could’ve shifted in the visitors’ favour.\n\n3. The Wahab dilemma\n\nTo play him or not to play him has become one of the major questions Pakistan faces whenever they go out in the field. If Afridi’s is the pinnacle of mercurial batting, Wahab is all that in the bowling department.\n\nOne day, he would pluck the moon out of the sky for Pakistan and the next day he would turn a certain victory into a miraculous defeat. Is it just bad luck, or is it just his bad bowling at some points, no one can truly answer.\n\nThe latter happened on Friday, when Wahab gave away 45 runs in just 3.5 overs after being hit for two sixes and five fours. New Zealand batsmen were bamboozled in the middle of the innings by some top-notch bowling by Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Faheem Ashraf, but Wahab leaking away runs gave New Zealand the much-needed confidence.\n\nAnd if all that was not enough, Faheem dropped a catch off Wahab at fine leg and to add insult to injury, let the ball crawl away for a four.\n\nIt is quite evident now that people are prone to dropping catches off Wahab’s bowling at fine leg and square leg region. Everyone would remember the disastrous drop in the 2015 World Cup by Rahat Ali where Wahab had setup Shane Watson perfectly with world class short-pitched bowling.\n\nSo, do we curse the man or do we curse his luck, at least I can’t answer this dilemma.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/comment1608294842-0/comment1608294842-0-68779.jpg"}, {"headline": "3 reasons Pakistan will find it difficult to beat New Zealand", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2274087/3-reasons-pakistan-will-find-it-difficult-to-beat-new-zealand", "date_published": "Mon, 30 Nov 20 07:44:32 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan contingent is currently in quarantine in New Zealand as they prepare for face the hosts in three T20Is and two Tests, and there is only one thing that is certain in the current uncertain Covid-19 time – it won’t be easy to beat the Kiwis.\n\nHere are the three main reasons why Babar Azam can return winless, in the series and in all the T20Is and Tests, from New Zealand.\n\n1. Bad morale\n\nAfter news of Pakistani players testing positive surfaced, the team must have seen a fall in their morale as, according to reports, many first team players were affected with the virus.\n\nThis could have led to drop in motivation, while a warning to send the whole squad home after some players breached the Covid-19 protocol was also not inspiring.\n\nPakistan players may be pumped up to beat New Zealand in the latter’s own yard after such humiliation, but with players in gloomy isolation, losing hope and feeling down may be the most probable outcome of the saga.\n\n2. Lack of fitness and practice\n\nEveryone knows about Pakistani’s love for food and our cricketers are just humans. With nothing much to do in hotel rooms, food might be the only entertainment they’ve had through the first half of their quarantine. Hence, a lack of practice may cause lethargy when they hit the ground.\n\nAll this may result in lack of efforts in the field and as the adage of catches win matches goes, a few slipups are a possibility too.\n\nPakistani players will have to put some extra yards in before the matches, otherwise, if they do just enough, the performances will also be just enough and New Zealand will roll over the Men in Green with ease.\n\n3. New Zealand’s form\n\nNew Zealand may not have won many global cricketing tournaments, but they are not known for their big trophy cabinet, they are known for their consistency.\n\nIf they are not the best on a given day, you can surely expect them to be at their minimum best at least. Meanwhile, their opponents Pakistan are known to be the most mercurial cricketing side in the world – “one minute down, next minute up”.\n\nIt is this consistency in New Zealand’s performance that makes them a difficult side to beat and add home advantage to that and it becomes a perfect recipe for Pakistan’s destruction in the series.\n\nAlso, they are unbeaten in the T20Is in the series against West Indies. Their form can be seen in the fact that they have scored quickly in the first two matches, setting a 239-run target in first and chasing a 180-run target in just 16 overs in the second.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistani players last played cricket during the remaining matches of the PSL5.\n\nMomentum will be on New Zealand’s side when they host Pakistan, first for T20Is and then for Tests. Babar will have to come up with a magical formula to lift the spirit of the players who will be feeling under the weather, homesick, and also out of form and practice. If the skipper can do that then he may not only go on to become a batting legend, but also a captain whose name would be written in golden words.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Comment1606722149-0/Comment1606722149-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Is Trump right in saying ‘India is filthy’?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2270253/is-trump-right-in-saying-india-is-filthy", "date_published": "Wed, 28 Oct 20 13:11:05 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhile the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden produced fireworks, Trump’s remarks in the environmental context that “India is filthy”, became a matter of heated debate within Indian media. Indian social media went berserk and its reaction also became prominent on mainstream media. Some went on to ask Trump for an apology on these remarks, which most of Sanghi trolls thought had hurt millions of common Indians.\n\nWhile any nation would react to such remarks from any leader of global stature, Trump’s remarks had a profound effect as Mr Modi has done a lot of work to develop a personal relationship with Trump through the “Howdy,Modi!” rally in the United States and “Namaste Trump” programme duringTrump’s visit to India this year.\n\nWhile we respect Indian sentiments, it may be interesting to conduct an analysis of where does India stand in terms of cleanliness and environment.\n\nAccording to IndiaSpend’sState of Global Air 2020 report,116,000 infants died in India due to air pollution in 2019 — meaning one infant died every five minutes due to air pollution. The data further reveals that 1.67 million Indians died in 2019 due to air pollution causes.\n\nAs per a World Health Organisation report, approximately 120,000 children under the age of five years die due to diarrhoea every year. This indicates that waterborne diseases are rampant in India due to contaminated water and poor sanitation.Hookworms, which can spread through open defecation, cause diarrhoea, anaemia and weight loss in women, according to the report. These problems are linked to low birth weight and slow child growth — 38% of children in India under five are stunted, according to the National Family Health Survey data.\n\nThe Indian magazine, The Wire, reported in 2017, that India, the world’s second-largest country by population, had the highest number of people (732 million) without access to toilets. The report by WaterAid, titled “Out Of Order: The State of the World’s Toilets 2017”, further stated that 355 million women and girls lacked access to a toilet. If they were to stand in a line, the queue could circle the Earth more than four times.\n\nThe problem is that Modi’sSwachh Bharat or Clean India programme built millions of toilets at avery fast pace across Indian landscape; however, these have become dilapidated and unusable,adding to the problem. Adding to that is the factor of demographics: Indian population has grown from 1,330 million in 2017 to 1,380 million in 2019, that’s an additional load of 50 million. So even if India builds one million new toilets every year it cannot match the pace of population growth.\n\nA CNet report published on September 11, 2020, states that India spent $30 billion to fix its broken sanitation. It ended up with more problems. The Swachh Bharat mission, launched in 2014, was an ambitious effort to stop open defecation. It's far from reaching that goal.Lack of enough water to use in Swachh Bharat was bound to make it a failure. Imagine a community toilet built for 500 people in a cramped city with irregular or no supply of water. Within a week, it will not only become unusable but also become a source of disease spread. A survey of open source pictures and videos of Swachh Bharat toilets in overpopulated cities indicates that this grand programme has become a virtual dustbin.\n\nIn 2019, India was also home to 21 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities, studies say, based on air-quality data. Coal usage in power generation stands at a whopping 75% and coal is notoriously bad for environment. No wonder New Delhi maintains the record of being the most polluted capital of the world for the second consecutive year. Even drinking water of the Indian capital is contaminated, The Hindu, in 2019,sarcastically remarked, “If it wasn’t enough that Delhi air is among the world’s most polluted, a new study has now shown that the city’s tap water is the most unsafe among 21 states within India.”\n\nIndian rivers have become almost toxic due to overpopulation and flow of sewage and industrial waste into rivers which hug large cities.Oceanplasticcleanup.com conducted a study of the most filthy, polluted and toxic rivers in the world called the “Dirty Dozen”, and lo and behold, India gets another honour with the Ganges as the second most polluted river in the world and Yamuna as the fifth filthiest.\n\nThe Ganges has a perennial problem of religious rituals.Gangapollution.com keeps a watch on issues related to it. One of its report highlighted the pollution in Indian rivers: many parts of the Hindu faith revolve around the Ganges River, who they believe is the form of the goddess Mother Ganga on Earth. Because of this, many people’s bodies and ashes are placed in the river. Large amounts of ashes from crematoriums along the Ganges River in Varanasi are dumped in each year. Majority of Hindus are cremated and placed in the river after being burned by Dalits along the ghats leading into their goddess’ body. These ashes are keeping the river from being clean.\n\nDead bodies are also a huge pollutant to the already dirty water, with 35,000 bodies estimated to be discarded into the river,yearly. This is huge amount of dead people to be floating in an important source of water for millions of people. Many times, international observers have pointed out to the Indian government to take effective measures for respect of human remains as pictures of human bodies floating in the Ganges River surface almost every month.\n\nOther than air pollution, poor sanitation, filthy rivers and water contamination, India stands tall in noise population as well.A LiveMintreport on noise pollution in India describes an alarming picture.\n\nThe red light at a traffic junction is the universal sign for vehicles to stop — but in India, it is also a signal to start something else: relentless honking. When noise from constant honking is added to the general cacophony in cities, it becomes noise pollution — and this pollution can be costly and dangerous too.\n\nKnops.co conducts regular surveys of noise pollution across the globe. Its 2018 report puts India in the top noise polluted countries in the world. The Worldwide Hearing Index was created some time ago by digital hearing app founders, Mimi Hearing Technologies GmbH. They analysed the hearing test results of 200,000 of their users. They combined their results with data on noise pollution from WHO and SINTEF, a Norwegian-based research organisation, and used it to plot noise pollution in 50 different cities. The top five cities with the worst noise pollution include Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nTo conclude, President Trump may have casually mentioned ‘filthy India’, referring to environmental issues without much attention to research and scientific evidence, but he has been proven right. India tops the list of the most polluted countries in the world in sanitation, water, air, hygiene and even noise.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2182545-adeelanaureennew-1584984008.jpg"}, {"headline": "Why we need fear for effective disaster risk reduction", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2268212/why-we-need-fear-for-effective-disaster-risk-reduction", "date_published": "Tue, 13 Oct 20 13:18:35 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tToday is the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and living in a time of a global pandemic, the need to prioritise disaster risk reduction has become resounding and all too very real as almost every person and community is suffering from institutional and socio-economic lack of preparedness. \n\nPandemics are not new. Scientists and historians have been warning against a global novel virus for the past few decades. Beating their beakers and drums, trying to raise awareness among governments and businesses that this is not of a matter of if, but when. When the Ebola outbreak wreaked havoc in West Africa, the US State Department, under then president Barack Obama’s administration developed a comprehensive guide in dealing with and mitigating infectious diseases. This was of course completely thrown out by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nOn October 8, just a few days ago, Pakistan saw the clock tick to 15 years since the devastating earthquake of 2005. Pakistan bore colossal losses then. Nearly 20,000 children died while they were attending classes. In total, about 85,000 people died, another 140,000 injured and 3.5 million became homeless as 0.6 million houses were severely damaged.\n\nPakistan’s north was particularly devastated and Balakot, the epicentre, was destroyed in a matter of seconds and 15 years on is still struggling to re-build infrastructure and lives. There is hardly any significant rehabilitation or reconstruction. Rather, the funds that were allotted for Balakot’s rehabilitation have been redistributed to the Benazir Income Support Programme(BISP) and Covid-19 Emergency Fund. This speaks to how ill-prepared our DRR is, that funds for one disaster are siphoned for others.\n\nDRR is an incredibly lofty goal for a country that cannot rehabilitate its citizens from disasters that took place almost two decades ago. Pakistan is not the only country unable to learn from past mistakes and lack of preparedness. As stated above, the US, and rather most countries during the Covid-19 pandemic have proven the amnesia that collectively surrounds us when it comes to the destruction of disasters.\n\nDanish philosopherSørenKierkegaard makes a distinction between the concept of dread and fear calling attention to fear as having an object, a definable threat that we can identify. Whereas, dread is a response shrouded in unknowns, is speculative, not belonging to parameters or definitions. \n\nWe are unequivocally living in a global time of fear. We fear the coronavirus, we fear loss of jobs, lives, travel, routine, any semblance to the “old normal”. Our fear is driving conversations and changes around the “Great Reset”: how can this disaster be learned from in such a way that we build back the world, better?\n\nWhat can be changed about the status quo that protects citizens beyond economic and political interests? \n\nHow can this ‘new’normal truly be transformative and inclusive?\n\nFear’s object allows for these conversations to have actionable points and attainable goals. Fear makes having a game-plan easier. Fear divides people into groups of: ‘part of the solution’ or ‘part of the problem,’ as is evidenced by corona-shaming of non-mask wearers and political leaders who had to retract fake news and disinformation.\n\nDRR for objects of fear, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, is timely and due to its global nature, which unlike Ebola which was predominantly contained within the context of “poor” countries, Covid-19’s fear is ubiquitous and has spread to contexts that are not used to suffering —‘developing country’ailments. The politics of fear is also always at play. Who is fearful,who is bearing the brunt of the threat is always imperative. Thus, DRR for infectious diseases is at the forefront of the priority list and perhaps, rightly so.\n\nDread on the other hand, is objectless, casting anxiety far and wide without aim and thus, is much more insurmountable than fear. Many of us dread climate change in an abstract way. We hear the news of sea levels rising. We notice the irregularities of the seasons. We breathe in toxic air like it is a non-negotiable aspect of nature. We watch gut-wrenching clips of starving farmers and drowning residents. \n\nOften though these realities are not directly our own. The dread and threat of climate change is still far away, neatly tucked away somewhere in the future. This is why business-as-usual is the state of affairs when it comes to the economy, government, consumer behaviour and social order. \n\nDRR for dread does not have the same timely impact as DRR for fear.\n\nUnlike DRR for infectious diseases, DRR for climate change is failing to account for human, social and political disaster amnesia.\n\nWhen dread turns to fear, as one may have experienced during the recent floods that engulfed Karachi and other parts of the country, there is suddenly an actionable sensibility that grips citizens and governments alike. Especially when those citizens were elites and urbane. The problem solving caps come on as people are united against a common threat.\n\nHowever, as human populations have made unprecedented exponential advancements in the last three decades, the myriad of threats have also of course, multiplied. Existential threats such as Artificial Intelligence, climate change, cyber warfare, pandemics, to name a few, have caused mounting existential dread invariably leading to inertia of sorts.\n\nI guess the trillion dollar question is: how do we capture what we know about the difference between fearand dread to formulate and implement DRR that works with the psychology and sociology of communities and countries?\n\nThis year, the theme of the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction is governance which is defined as the measure by which“lives are saved, reduced numbers of disaster-affected people and reduced economic losses. Covid-19 and the climate emergency are telling us that we need a clear vision, plans and competent, empowered institutions acting on scientific evidence for the public good.”\n\nUnfortunately, we are all still enveloped in a fear-centric mode of thinking when it comes to DRR. For instance, Prime Minister Imran Khan has recently approved the construction of high-rise buildings in Islamabad. This is problematic for several reasons from a DRR and urban planning perspective.\n\nFirstly, contrary to popular opinion, high-rises are not green solutions. In fact, high-rises encourage vehicular clutter causing serious damage to both environment and humans alike, by increasing air pollution. Vertical urban sprawl wreaks havoc on air quality. \n\nSecondly, high-rise buildings are energy-intensive as glass is simply not very good at keeping excessive heat out, or desirable heat in. Even with technological advancement, the amount of power it takes to keep high-rises going poses a huge opportunity cost to greener solutions. \n\nLastly, Pakistan has many seismic zones and as many high-rises are vulnerable to earthquakes and not always structurally sound, the proliferation of high-rises in the country can pose mammoth near-future risks. Furthermore, high-rises, pose evacuation concerns. If you live or work in a high-rise apartment, you'll face a harder challenge trying to evacuate due to emergencies, such as natural disasters or fire.\n\nIt is said, “earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings do,” which begs the question why is our government taking urban planning measures that are increasing disaster risks rather than reducing them?\n\nOur Prime Minister has repeatedly said, “ghabrana nahi hai (don’t get scared)”; but, when it comes to disaster risk reduction, it would be very wise to be fearful.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Mavra-Bari1602595736-0/Mavra-Bari1602595736-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Public complaints", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2265484/public-complaints", "date_published": "Thu, 24 Sep 20 19:06:54 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn order to further facilitate the public and speed up redressal of their grievances, the government plans to link up all complaint management systems of federal ministries with the Pakistan Citizen Portal. Prime Minister Imran Khan recently issued instructions in this regard. All existing 33 complaint cells of federal ministries will be connected with the centralised complaint system. The PM’s Performance Delivery Unit (PMDU) will decide the modalities in consultation with relevant institutions and devise integration plans. The PMDU has been asked to complete the process within 60 days. The idea is to avoid delays resulting from a multiplicity of complaint cells and duplication of efforts thereby undertaking the process of complaint rectification on a fast track basis. This will also save time and resources. The purpose is to put in place a universal system with many-faceted connectivity features for a comprehensive global grievance redressal mechanism.\n\nThe centralised system will help citizens avoid confusion as now a number of complaint cells are functioning causing problems to both the people and government functionaries working for redressal of public grievances. The integrated system will help eliminate the delays involved in manual processing of complaints. It will bring the whole process of receipt, processing, and removal of complaints under one window, and help citizens get information about the status of their complaints and things related to them. The PCP started functioning as part of the PMDU from October 2018. During the past two years, as many as 28 million people have registered 115,000 complaints, on average, every month, with it. According to official figures, 2.2 million complaints have been resolved with 40% confirmed satisfaction. The rural population might not be getting the facility of the online PCP because of the unavailability of internet services in villages and small towns.

The false dreams that many of them have are regularly shattered by the harsh reality of India’s still-strong caste system, which rarely allows lower-caste Hindus to rise. Many of the Pakistani Hindu migrants are from those lower castes. For this, they often end up having to wait for decades to be allowed to become citizens of a country that claims to welcome all Hindus.\n\nPakistan Hindu Council Patron-In-Chief Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani made a much more explosive claim that Indian intelligence agencies have been forcing Pakistani Hindu migrants and tourists to speak against Pakistan and even killing people who refuse to do so. As evidence, Vankwani referred to the last month’s case of 11 members of a family who died under mysterious circumstances in the Indian city of Jodhpur in Rajasthan. The family had moved there years ago, motivated by those same false promises of a better life in India. Instead, they ended up being poisoned in their home.\n\nThe case itself is interesting for the secretive manner in which India has acted. The family of subsistence farmers was clearly not spies, yet India has refused to share any investigation details with Pakistan or allowed access to the survivors, even though they all were still Pakistani citizens at the time they died.\n\nVankwani implied that this was because a surviving family member had nominated the RSS and the ruling BJP in the police report. He also noted that no arrests had been made in the case which is extremely concerning.\n\nAfter decades of throwing accusations about the treatment of Hindus in neighbouring Muslim countries, India has shown that it is just as dangerous.

Unfortunately, failure to update election and political financing laws, or even enforce existing ones, is a collective failure of the political parties and the bureaucracy because it deprives citizens of their basic rights, while also ensuring that truly independent candidates from middle-class or poor backgrounds just can’t compete with the big guns. But maybe that is the point — securing the positions of the ruling elite while also ensuring that they stay in line. \n\nOver the weekend, open government and election transparency advocates at the Free and Fair Election Network , or Fafen, also brought up how political parties inside and outside the parliament need to strengthen regulations to limit the ability of big spenders to virtually buy elections, warning that free-spending without consequences deprives citizens of the right to contest elections and skews results towards big spenders, regardless of whether they are backed by billionaires or smaller, individual donors. \n\nThe weaknesses in the system begin with the current iteration of the law governing elections — the Elections Act of 2017. The act is astoundingly weak in its grants of regulatory power, and can be directly blamed — along with its authors — for allowing the 2018 general election to turn into the biggest spending polling cycles in the country’s history, even when inflation is taken into account. Bye-elections and local bodies polls conducted since then have also seen unprecedented spending, effectively consolidating power among the ultra-rich, whether directly as candidates or through the political parties they bankroll. Strongly enforced spending caps can be problematic in bigger constituencies and areas with higher advertising costs, but they are still probably the easiest place to start. \n\nDonor transparency is another area which needs to be investigated. This could be done through a public database which parties and candidates must regularly update with every political donation received and details of how funds are spent. The same would also apply to private groups and individuals financing political campaigns. Criminal penalties, as long as they are fairly applied, would be more than enough to change the face of Pakistani electioneering, certainly making it cleaner and, hopefully, a little more representative.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 11th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "PDM fiddles while the economy burns", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369873/pdm-fiddles-while-the-economy-burns", "date_published": "Sat, 06 Aug 22 18:44:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe only thing seesawing faster than the Pakistani rupee right now is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s political capital. So, here’s a contrarian take on what’s happening to the Pakistani economy. The real crisis is one of confidence, and not just economic fundamentals. Consider this: Pakistan faced a similar economic crisis at the beginning of PTI’s term and then again at the beginning of Covid-19. In both cases, stability and economic growth were restored. In fact, unlike most countries where public debt rose significantly during Covid-19, we were able to reduce our public debt-to-GDP ratio by about five percentage points through Covid-19. So, why does this economic crisis feel like the end of the world?\n\nThe underlying crisis of confidence this time is rooted in politics versus economics. Let’s unpack the previous economic crisis Pakistan overcame to contextualise this one better. To simplify, PTI’s core challenge in 2018 was inheriting an unsustainable current account deficit with the country standing on the brink of dollar default, while PML-N’s core challenge was to reverse fuel subsidies. The first two years of PTI’s government were hard for our economy because PML-N gave an ailing economy to Asad Umar. \n\nThe primary challenge was a current account deficit of $20 billion thanks to Dar’s fixation on keeping the rupee artificially overvalued versus the dollar. An artificially high rupee meant it was cheaper to import things than to produce them in Pakistan or export goods. Hence, our industry hollowed out, exports declined during PML-N’s tenure and imports we couldn’t afford thrived, bringing us to the verge of bankruptcy when PTI took over. \n\nPTI took politically unpopular but wise decisions to correct these sins, including the painful devaluation of the currency. The idea was they would rescue the economy first, then stabilise and then put it on the growth path. Halfway through stabilisation, Covid-19 hit. Despite Covid-19 though, Pakistan clocked in growth at over 5% over the last two years. This was so good that PML-N argued last year that the numbers had been fudged by the PTI government, only to validate growth numbers this year after over-throwing the PTI government. PML-N even used these healthy growth numbers to secure the latest IMF deal. \n\nHowever, when the PML-N was strategising to overthrow PTI through a vote of no confidence, their primary argument was that PTI was mismanaging the economy and a competent team was needed to restore order. Four months later, we are experiencing the fruits of labour from team competence, with the rupee nosediving and inflation skyrocketing. \n\nIn a provocative recent column, former State Bank Governor, Raza Baqir asks why this crisis feels more dramatic when the economic fundamentals are actually better than before: ‘Given that we successfully restored stability and growth in the recent two challenging crises, why is there not a shared sense of calm confidence that we should be able to do the same this time round? This question is particularly relevant because our reserves and public debt are better today than they were in the 2019 balance-of-payments crisis before the start of the IMF programme. At end-June 2019, our gross reserves had dipped to around $7bn; at end-June 2022 they were around $10bn.’\n\nHe goes on to argue about the central role politics is playing in this crisis. And the next logical question to ask is what is the core driver of the political instability in the country today? The answer to that question is simple, the vote of no confidence against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The irony is that while PDM brought a no-confidence motion against Imran Khan, it’s the Pakistani economy that’s expressing no confidence in the PDM government today. If there’s one lesson everyone can learn from this train wreck, it’s that civilian Prime Ministers should be allowed to complete their five-year terms for both political and economic stability.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 7th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131.JPG"}, {"headline": "Afghan humanitarian crisis", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369656/afghan-humanitarian-crisis", "date_published": "Fri, 05 Aug 22 18:34:35 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfghanistan has a long history of destruction and suffering, be it man-inflicted or natural. Since the Russian invasion in December 1979, Afghanistan has become a battleground of world superpowers and is surrounded by an unending wave of destruction.\n\nAfter the foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan, Pakistan hosted an exclusive Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference to discuss the Afghanistan issue. The conference focused on the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and exploring new avenues to address the rapidly worsening humanitarian situation in terms of food shortage and potential economic collapse. Foreign ministers of member countries, special invitees from the United Nations (UN), international financial institutions, and non-member states, including the US, UK, European Union, and Russia attended the session. Afghanistan’s delegation was headed by the acting foreign minister.\n\nPakistan’s initiative to host the 17th session of the emergency meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the OIC demonstrated Pakistan’s strong will to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan. All member countries unanimously agreed that peace and stability in the region can only be achieved by forming a broad-based and inclusive government that is representative of the entire Afghan society. \n\nDecades of conflict and instability in Afghanistan have left millions of people on the brink of starvation. Some 24 million Afghans were already in need of humanitarian assistance because of the economic crisis and lack of development aid. The situation was further exacerbated after the recent earthquake in Paktia and Khost, which left nearly 1,500 dead and many more injured. \n\nFollowing the earthquake, the Afghan government appealed for international support to address the crisis. The Pakistani government responded immediately by dispatching consignments of relief goods. On 22nd June, the first convoy of 8 trucks carrying tents, tarpaulin, and blankets from the National Disaster Management Authority reached Afghanistan. On 24th June, another consignment of relief assistance was sent through aircraft. Besides this, Pak-Afghan Cooperation Forum (PACF) also sent 5 trucks carrying 37.5 tons of food, winter bedding, tents, tarpaulins, and clothes. \n\nEarlier, PACF had also organised free eye camps in the hospitals in Kabul and Khost where thousands of Afghan patients were provided free treatment by Pakistani doctors. The forum also facilitated the first batch of Afghan children with congenital diseases who will receive free medical treatment in Pakistan. \n\nTo promote bilateral trade with Afghanistan, the Pakistani government decided to relax the visa policy to ensure long-term and sustainable trade between the two countries. Under the new policy, six months of multiple entry visas will be issued to transporters from Afghanistan. Pakistan has also decided to import coal from Afghanistan, which can help Pakistan generate cheaper electricity and save nearly $2.3 billion. \n\nSince August 2021, the economic crisis and collapse of the banking sector have made it extremely challenging to get money into Afghanistan. International humanitarian organisations and the UN have scaled up assistance to address rising needs, but aid cannot replace the services of the state. To institutionalise financial support, a trust fund was established at the OIC conference. However, the international community remains reluctant to allow cash inflow.\n\nDuring this difficult time, the international community must lift sanctions and release Afghan funds as the country has descended into a serious economic crisis. The international community must realise that this is not the time to settle scores or debate on issues of legitimacy or recognition. They must resume aid and support the Afghan people to mitigate their miseries. \n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 6th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Javed-Iqbal1659724580-1/Javed-Iqbal1659724580-1.jpg"}, {"headline": "Dialogue urged to end political uncertainty", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369231/dialogue-urged-to-end-political-uncertainty", "date_published": "Wed, 03 Aug 22 07:47:41 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tChief of Qaumi Watan Party (QWP), Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao on Tuesday while showing concern over current political state of affairs, suggested a grand dialogue for all political par-\nties to ease the situation.\n\nTalking to media persons, Aftab Sherpao said if a grand dialogue among political entities was not held, it would be harmful for the country and its economy.\n\nSuggesting two resolutions to end wrangling between the political parties, Sherpao said in politics the doors of negotiations and dialogue were never kept closed.\n\nHe said if Hasina Wajid and Khaleda Zia could sit on one table in Bangladesh for the sake of their country, then why the government and opposition in Pakistan cannot have reconciliation dialogue.\n\nHe said the political mercury which has touched the new heights of confrontation needed to be brought down through talks.\n\nThe confronting politics, he said, have also badly hit the country’s economy that was a matter of great concern and must be understood by the politicians.

Recently, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the Padma Bridge and declared it a ‘symbol of pride and capacity’. As early as 1992, Sheikh Hasina was involved in the economic issues and plans for Bangladesh. She undertook the task of balancing economic policies with political implications. Sheikh Hasina shifted focus from her father’s socialist agenda toward market-based capitalist growth. She learnt from other Asian countries whose economic success was based upon four pillars: political stability, social development, trade liberalisation with export-led growth and fiscal restraint.\n\nDuring a conference, when an economist began informing her about the benefits of trade liberalisation, Sheikh Hasina quipped, “you don’t have to convince me about trade liberalisation. When I was living with my physicist husband in the Italian city of Trieste on the Yugoslavian border, I watched the border being opened three times a week and people travelling across from both sides, purchasing goods and return.” This demonstrates that Sheikh Hasina was assiduously focused on economics rather than other considerations that politicians are attracted to. \n\nEven though between 1971 to 2009, Bangladesh had hiccups in accountability campaigns and military rule, since 2009, the army has taken the back seat. Bangladesh has seen less frequent derailment of civilian governments and experienced little legitimisation and delegitimization of governments. Although its democratic history is not untainted, Bangladesh’s government has largely avoided public criticism about corruption and inefficiency. Despite having little experience in governance, the Prime Minister possessed visionary acuity and conviction that economic progress was the only way to alleviate poverty in the country. \n\nAlthough marred by allegations of coercion of opponents, after over fifteen years of sustained growth, Bangladesh has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Back in 1970, the country was 75% poorer compared to Pakistan but now it is 45% richer. In 1970, it had 10 million more mouths to feed but now its population is 170 million compared to Pakistan’s 230 million. In 2021, Bangladesh’s exports were $47 billion while Pakistan’s exports were $28 billion. The income per capita in Bangladesh is $2,227 compared to Pakistan’s $1,543. In 2022, its gross domestic product (GDP) is $411 billion compared to the $347 billion in Pakistan. The annual inflation rate is 6% compared to Pakistan’s previous 12-15%, which has now risen to 21% and is expected to further increase. Also, the Bangladeshi taka is much stronger compared to the Pakistani rupee. Importantly, Bangladesh has a strong literacy rate with high female participation in the economy.\n\nIn Pakistan, political parties have remained interested in personal gains. The repeated manipulation of the democratic process has stymied the growth of strong, democratic, and non-dynastic parties. It is worth recognising that economic growth is closely tied with political stability, rule of law, strong civilian institutions, and participatory democracy. Pakistan inherited an overdeveloped state with a feeble bourgeoise linked in a patron-client relationship with a powerful state. The country has inevitably witnessed an economic and political evolution marked by privilege and patronage. Agriculture and business incomes are primarily excluded from the tax net. There is an absence of progressive wealth tax and huge industrial and estate complexes are exempt from any levies. Our parliament is dominated by landlords, it is a small wonder that agriculture income tax has been relegated as an inconsequential subject to the provincial domain. Consequently, the tax net remains small as agriculture and industrial sectors are undertaxed.\n\nSince 1958, all experiments with the government have augmented feudal power instead of empowering the masses. The growth path pursued in Pakistan has been skewed in favour of the privileged, rich, and elite who must now make their fair contribution to the state. \n\nFollowing Bangladesh’s example, Pakistani leadership must pursue economic growth as the national agenda and adopt constitutionalism along with regional peace. Without compromising viable defence, adequate resources must be released for social and economic development. Considering that regional avenues of growth necessitate trade liberalisation, foreign trade agreements must be formed with India, Iran, China, Afghanistan, and other trading partners. Also, the export-led growth model should refocus on high-value-added goods.\n\nPakistan enjoys a comparative advantage in cheaper labour, which must be transformed to improve skills and productivity. Education and technical training for women must be promoted and adopted widely to increase women’s participation in the workforce. Also, a safe and legally conducive environment is crucial for foreign investments. \n\nA serious effort is required to levy a fair tax on agricultural incomes and the rich industrial cartels must make their due contribution to national wealth. Besides wealth and death taxes, large corporate and estate sectors need to be brought into the tax net.\n\nPakistan’s leadership can learn many lessons from Bangladesh’s experience, but the main takeaway should be that Sheikh Hasina prioritised economic growth, which is crucial for both defence and democracy.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 2nd, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Sahibzada-Riaz-Noor1655837455-1/Sahibzada-Riaz-Noor1655837455-1.jpg"}, {"headline": "A stitch in time", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368349/a-stitch-in-time", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Jul 22 19:56:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhen Imran Khan first came to power, he repeatedly lamented the insufficient political space to pursue his promised agenda. PTI was new to governance and struggled to find direction. This found comparisons with other governance models mostly bordering on unchecked power and singular control. The closest we come to it in a democracy is the presidential form but it sits against the ethos of a parliamentary governance model — more popularly accepted given our peculiar political environment. Legislation and parliamentary support for substantial reform stood unattended and PTI’s agenda remained undelivered. That was the moment to return to the electorate for a new mandate through a snap, mid-term or early election. He dithered and stalled till the chips fell. And then it was too late.\n\nToday the nation and the state is at a cross-road and most paths lead out to further disaster than seen in the last six months. It may be politics to those engaged in it but it spells life and death for a nation. There hasn’t been a more precarious moment in our national history. Politics, so used to arbitration, isn’t finding one at the moment — so controversial have the traditional points of mediation turned. The army and its leadership was maligned at will for the most part of the last six years. Any insinuation of the army’s leadership amounts to deliberate subversion, sedition and disruption in the military order. It is now a daily fodder. That the military politicised itself so much as to be a fair game is something for it to ponder over and deal with; but in a country where institutions have had to lend a hand in governance, their need to arbitrate when politicians feud will never go away. With such malicious and vicious attacks on it, the military has been literally neutralised.\n\nMaking courts controversial is the next ploy. The focus is on subverting the judiciary in public non-cooperation to contrive decisions of a side’s liking. A political system’s inability to resolve its own predicaments means that courts are asked to arbitrate. They are then framed for activism and judicial coups in public narrative when decisions don’t go their way. This is patent blackmail. In an environment where the economy is on the verge of crashing, if not already crashed, the threat of a default looms, 120 million people of Punjab have been without a functioning government for the last four months at the hands of political shenanigan-ism, the military is fighting a rear-guard action against terrorism in its midst, and the international environment is tenuous, fragile and laden against us politically and economically, governance is a non-functioning entity while politics is at best fratricidal and predatory. Those responsible for each of these, fiddle instead in crass opportunistic entanglement. There isn’t an institution left that has not been tarnished. So complete is the insinuation and slander. The crisis meanwhile only deepens and engorges us from all sides.\n\nThere are four possible ways-out from the current predicament:\n\n1) There can be a reset of the entire thing as has been the traditional resort when the army intervened and installed a transitional government after it had stalled into inaction. It has always left serious negative consequences to politics and governance in the country and skewed the balance of power unfairly. In the army itself the effects are substantively adverse and distasteful to its own professional culture. It is best avoided.\n\n2) The courts may declare a state of mis-governance in the country and an absence of a government that strictly conforms to the legal, constitutional and moral mandate to claim power. It may then emplace a national government composed of both political and non-political technocrats to fill-in for a period of 6 months to a year to reform and reset what has become broken in the normal course of things resulting in political stagnation. Historically, political classes have manipulated constitutional and legal statutes in their favour. Politics has also tended to corrupt the judicial system through inducement or fear of retribution or manipulation through parliamentary power to proverbially cut the wings of what is perceived a largely independent judiciary — a sine qua non in a democratic state. This option may seem appealing given our state of disorder and institutional break-down, though political parties for the most part will play spoilers to this arrangement by disassociating and disowning the reform process. Arbitrating structures must find a way to engage with political structures to make them a willing part of the process. A constitutional protection will be needed to safeguard any statutory recourse for making governance more sustainable and consistent.\n\n3) The third option is the Sri Lankan way. When the control of the government and its capacity to govern melted away, the only remaining power was that of the people on the streets. Law enforcement agencies could only do so much in the initial stages of the uprising but as soon as it got bigger and voluminous, law enforcement drew back to avoid bloodshed against its own citizens. The option engenders anarchy and chaos, and fragments a nation’s and a society’s core ethos as well as its physical and structural pillars. A nation may then dissolve and a state may cease to exist. In a nuclear-capable nation, it remains unthinkable and will invite intervention, even external. Although Imran Khan has waved this bogey often in a hope to elicit institutional support in favour of his political objectives, it remains a red-flag event needing constant monitoring. Khan has been very poorly and insidiously advised to use this option as a ploy. We have enough political and moral acumen in the country to save us from such a disastrous consequence.\n\n4) Our polity, so used to external arbitration, perhaps needs it the most in current times. It stands dysfunctional and polarised to the point of rupture. Seemingly there exists little possibility for political players to come together in consensus on critical issues. Such is the intensity and depth of the divide. Yet it remains the only saviour out of our debilitating predicament. The President, the army, and the judiciary will need to come together at this precarious moment beyond their respective constitutional domains to avoid a multi-sectoral meltdown of the state and the nation. The agreed mechanism in the 1973 constitution continues to be either subverted or manipulated for political favour, forcing resort to the judiciary for adjudication. Necessary tweaking of laws and statutes may be needed in a consensus to enable sustainable, resilient, transparent and effective governance both at the center and in the provinces. Early elections and a new mandate are essential for a credible government to carry an effective voice with multilateral and bilateral partners.\n\nA half derelict non-concern for a free-falling economy by the government seems more a ploy to keep the powers-that-be interested in rushing the props to keep the government in place. Such purposed neglect is insidious and needs immediate redressal. We cannot sit idly by as negative politics unravels the order. A stitch in time will save us some more.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 29th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Shahzad-Chaudhry1592677757-0/Shahzad-Chaudhry1592677757-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan pulls out of India chess event", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368293/pakistan-pulls-out-of-india-chess-event", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Jul 22 06:50:07 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan have withdrawn from the world's biggest international chess tournament in protest at hosts India holding a torch relay for the event through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Thursday.\n\nThe 44th Chess Olympiad will see over 1,700 players from 188 nations compete in Chennai from now until August 10.\n\nThe last two competitions were played virtually because of the pandemic.\n\nThe Kashmir dispute has weathered decades of violence and upheaval since it was partitioned between India and Pakistan when both countries became independent in 1947.\n\nThe neighbours both claim it in full and have fought two of their three wars over control of the territory.\n\n\"By passing the torch relay through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir...

And yet, the military-industrial complex continues to thrive, elite capture remains elusive, and the juggernaut of divisive politics continues to cause fissures in our cultural zeitgeist. A colossal amount of black money — Pakistan’s illegitimate parallel economy — remains unseen, unreported and untaxed. Whether we are a police officer or a judge, a petty officer or a general, a building contractor or a factory owner, we continue to lie, cheat and defraud others and our country on our way to achieving our goals. Our economy and our morality both are on the cusp of default. As a society, we cannot stoop lower.\n\nIf there is one trait that defines political leadership like none other, it is narcissism. In our frenzied political landscape, knocking at the door of the Supreme Court has become an obsessive-compulsive ritual. If our politicians don’t get what they want, they are quick to approach the highest bench. Regardless of which party they belong to, if the judges rule in their favour, they are hailed as honest and impartial; if the judgements go against them, the same judges are deemed as partial and biased.\n\nOn July 22, a letter was waved once again, this time in the chamber of the Punjab Assembly. This time, it was the Hamza-Elahi face-off. We were back to watching television news shows where uncouth tirades were interrupted by even more uncouth tirades hurled by so-called political pundits. But here is the gist of the problem: legal discussions on the constitutionality of a matter are enlightening, they’re a thing of beauty; but when polluted by partisanship, these same discussions lose their intellectual value.\n\nWhy are politicians so obsessed with hanging on to power? The answer lies in the question itself: power. And this brings me to the power paradox which simply means that we act with empathy and modesty at first but quickly turn to coercion, manipulation and exploitation as soon as we acquire power. Whether we are corporate executives or CEOs, monarchs or political leaders, or even patriarchs in a patriarchal society, the power paradox applies to all of us. Inherent within us is a proclivity for pathological addiction to power, vanity and self-importance.\n\nIs greed a precursor to the power paradox? Is greed the driving force for success? Gordon Grekko, a character played by Michael Douglas in the movie Wall Street, puts it bluntly when he says, “the point is ladies and gentlemen that greed is, for lack of a better word, good.” The fact remains that we are rats in a rat race. Greed feeds our egos. Greed also divides us between the haves and the have-nots, between the exploiters and the exploited. Karl Marx was prophetic about our fate under capitalism: “Money is the universal, self-constituted value of all things. It has therefore robbed the whole world, human as well as natural, of its own values.”\n\nOut of hope or despair, we follow political leaders only to be ushered to the innermost circle of hell. On the one hand, we have political clans that remind us of the Sicilian mafia, the Cosa Nostra. On the other hand, we have a self-aggrandising braggart who shares a passing resemblance with Mussolini. We gather in thousands and listen to them deliver inspiring speeches just like Hitler did about a hundred years ago or Donald Trump more recently. They promise to save our country, to restore our lost glory, our greatness and excellence, while they make secret deals behind closed doors in the dead of the night.\n\nIn Botan Doro, a chilling ghost story, a handsome Japanese samurai falls in love with a beautiful girl carrying a lantern who visits his town every night but disappears before dawn.

Not that Pakistan has a history of clean politics but the present crisis especially in Punjab is extremely serious and is taking place when global and regional conditions are pitched against us.\n\nMore consequential is the fact that the country’s economy is in dire straits and the government is desperately seeking IMF and friendly countries to bail it out. Instead of focusing on the best use of scarce resources to satisfy the needs of the people, mismanagement is making matters worse. History seems to be repeating itself as both PTI and the PML-N-led coalition are seeking the support of the army leadership and putting pressure on the judiciary to tilt verdicts in their favour. Whatever tactics the government may employ to stay in power in Punjab and at the Center will only add to the misery of the silent majority, and strengthen the army’s leverage.\n\nImran Khan’s deliberate policy of ignoring democratic institutions and shunning the opposition defies the basic concept of pluralism and tends toward dictatorial instincts. When the entire political energy is geared towards demolishing the opponent instead of presenting oneself as a better candidate or party through performance, the political scenario can turn ugly very quickly. And this situation we are already witnessing. Besides, the prevalent policy of all political parties of blocking programs and initiatives that the previous government had initiated irrespective of country needs has to cease. By such inimical responses the worst affected are the ordinary people. It is unfortunate that the ruling party and the opposition are weakening the political structure and pursuing policies that undermine the economy and lower the image of the country. Moreover, such elite and party polarisation has filtered down at the grass-root level.\n\nIn all the main political parties — PML-N, PTI and PPP — there is excessive concentration of power in the top leadership that is preventing the advantage of making and implementing better policies that would have emerged otherwise from valuable input from the higher tier leadership where sufficient talent and experience resides. Unless political parties do not internally democratise, there is scant hope of improving the quality of democracy at the national, provincial and local levels. Moreover, when political parties have a mix of conservative and liberal, educated and experienced in sufficient numbers, politics of compromise and a certain level of decorum prevails. That seems a long way off and our present challenge is how to reduce the animosity and bitter rivalry among political parties. The flow of dirty money to influence political behaviour has become common place and politicians, instead of enacting laws and taking disciplinary action against the violators, are frequently promoting it. Checks and balances are already in our system but these are largely ignored. We have to work towards the goal to revive these, but to expect that our politicians in their present state of mind would be thinking along these lines would be day-dreaming. Can we also afford to give up and let the country continue to slide?\n\nAdding to our national woes is the adverse international environment. The Russia-US confrontation over Ukraine requires deft handling of foreign relations and the economy in which a better understanding and cooperation of major political parties is necessary. Due to accelerating global inflation and scarcity of basic essentials, especially of fuel, agricultural and industrial products, not only are the prices rapidly increasing but they are frequently becoming scarce. Unfortunately, there is hardly any realisation of these developments that is reflected in the political behaviour.\n\nThe US-China rivalry has also stepped up as President Biden has taken an aggressive posture toward China to dampen its fast-growing economy and influence in the coming years. Apart from its overall negative global fallout, it creates not only economic but also strategic restraints on Pakistan. It would remain a challenge for Pakistan diplomacy to steer this hostile terrain. While remaining steadfast in maintaining a strategic relationship with China, Pakistan should seek close relations with the US in terms of economy and trade. But, here too there is no serious thought being given apart from leaving it to our diplomats. Fortunately, we have highly professional and dedicated diplomats, and presently a competent Foreign Minister that is managing foreign policy astutely under trying conditions. What cannot be overlooked is that Pakistan’s foreign policy would carry weight when Pakistan is internally stable and its economy is strong.\n\nWhat is worrisome is that in this anarchic domestic situation, education, infrastructure, healthcare, and research and development are being ignored with serious consequences for the country’s future. The IT revolution and expansion of globalisation has been only partially absorbed. Leaders struggling for political survival are thinking and planning largely on a short horizon and neglecting these areas. This also has to do with the quality of the power structure and priorities that are driven by special or personal interests. Similarly, how many politicians are listening to the lone voice and warnings of Sherry Rehman on climate change and global warming. Or that of Raza Rabbani, Aitzaz Ahsan on wise political and constitutional issues. Successive government leaderships have been unwilling to open their minds to issues that are long-term, despite the reality that climate change is occurring right here largely due to human activities. There is an urgent need to give serious thought on how to respond to it and should invite interest across the political spectrum.\n\nBut despite the highly disturbing political and economic situation we are experiencing, it can all change provided some sanity among top political leadership prevails. Imran Khan has to lower his rhetoric, take serious issues to parliament and refrain from shaking the frail political structure. And the PDM coalition leadership should avoid political vendetta, take effective measures toward improving governance and lifting the economy while the clock is still ticking.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 27th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1083504-TalatMasoodNew-1460481455/1083504-TalatMasoodNew-1460481455.JPG"}, {"headline": "PM Shehbaz's son in the soup for 'incitement to violence' on Twitter", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2365432/pm-shehbazs-son-in-the-soup-for-incitement-to-violence-on-twitter", "date_published": "Sat, 09 Jul 22 11:12:07 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfter a Twitter account purportedly belonging to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's oldest son --- Suleman Sharif, urged his followers to \"toss shoes\" and \"name and shame\" a family that heckled Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal in a viral video on Friday, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf supporters heavily trolled the businessman's post and called for the account to be blocked for trying to incite violence.\n\n\n\nمیرے شیرو جہاں اس فیملی کو دیکھو۔ جوتے مارو۔ اس گنڈا گرد اور گنڈا لیڈر @ImranKhanPTI اور چورنی پیرنی نظر آئے 🦯 تیار رکھو۔ https://t.co/2srX5PMXJ9\n— Zi Suleman Sharif (@zi_suleman) July 8, 2022\n\n\nIqbal was targeted by PTI supporters as he stood in a queue waiting to place his order in a fast food joint at Bhera Interchange near Punjab's Sargodha.

But with many provinces across Pakistan witnessing unprecedented levels of rain, dengue could very well escalate into a national health crisis. This merits attention from the very top.\n\nSurveillance campaigns must be carried out across flood affected areas to identify and destroy breeding grounds.

Doctors have advised citizens to take precautions to avoid catching the disease during the current weather conditions.\n\nAccording to Ophthalmologist Dr Tahir Farooq, conjunctivitis is an eye infection that spreads rapidly from one person to another. “Generally, this infection gains momentum in the summer or rainy season. During moist weather conditions, conjunctivitis spreads very rapidly but it can be prevented by taking preventive measures,” he said.\n\nHe said that people must frequently wash hands and avoid hand-to-eye contact to keep eye infections at bay. \n\nThe doctor said that people should avoid rubbing their eyes with fingers as they contain germs and can lead to an infection. He said that people should not share towels, napkins etc as doing so can raise the risk of suffering from eye infections.\n\nNaveed Shams, a patient suffering from conjunctivitis, said that seven out of 11 persons in his house have fallen prey to conjunctivitis.\n\nPatients suffering from the disease feel severe irritation in their eyes and it becomes very difficult to open their eyes in the sunlight. “The patient's eyes become red and water starts discharging from the eyes. I have been visiting the doctor for the last three days, but I did not get any sort of relief,” he said adding that he was following the precautionary measures said by the doctor so that other members of his household would not catch the disease.\n\nAccording to the data obtained from three allied hospitals in Rawalpindi, the number of patients with conjunctivitis has increased in the rainy season as compared to normal days\n\nAs per statistics released by the three allied hospitals, 12 more patients suffering from conjunctivitis have landed in hospitals in the last 24 hours.\n\nEye disease expert Dr Mudassar said that conjunctivitis can also be caused by dust rising after the rain. He said that polluted air and excessive use of fast lighting devices were also the cause of this disease. \n\nHe said that citizens have to show responsibility to prevent the spread of conjunctivitis. He said that the water discharged from the patient's eyes is toxic and when a patient cleans it with his hands, it becomes infected and the disease could be transmitted to other people through shaking hands.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 18th, 2022.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1732991-eyesurgery_reuters-1528782738/1732991-eyesurgery_reuters-1528782738.jpg"}, {"headline": "Two cops killed in attack on polio team in Tank", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2371443/two-cops-killed-in-attack-on-polio-team-in-tank", "date_published": "Tue, 16 Aug 22 08:29:27 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tTwo policemen were killed in an attack on a polio team by armed men on Tuesday in the Tank district of ​​Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).\n\nAccording to the police, constables Pir Rehman and Nisar died in the shooting and their bodies have been shifted to the hospital.

In a globalised world, the internet is no longer a luxury.\n\n“The internet is one of the greatest inventions of all time,” said blogger and influencer Nouman Younus. It has changed our lives in so many ways and is making life easier for us. “We can communicate with people from anywhere in the world, share our thoughts, get inspired by other people's ideas, learn new things and much more.”\n\n“Internet is an important service that sustains our digital age,” said Soban Khan, a first-year student of BS computer sciences. “Internet has been a source of information and communication globally. This connectivity enables people to communicate with each other across the globe.”\n\nThe internet was a large network of computers, according to Khan. It was also a network of networks, which were connected together in a web-like configuration. “The internet is made up of many other networks, each with its own purpose and function — some for hosting websites, others for government agencies and businesses, he said.\n\nAnd then there are those who use it simply to connect with other people around the world.\n\nThe internet had been used for numerous purposes, said Nouman Younus. “Students can use the internet to access information and resources, as well as communicate with other classmates, he added.\n\n“It is also used for social purposes. People use the internet to connect with others and share ideas that may not be shared offline, such as through social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter.”\n\nPeople used the internet to watch videos about the subjects they were interested in, listen to music that matches their taste, play games or read books online, said Soban Khan.\n\n“The internet has become an indispensable part of our life. It is used for entertainment, communication, education and work. It is also used for banking, shopping and healthcare as well as research.”\n\nRead more: Heavy rains, floods cause internet outages in Pakistan\n\nAccording to Nouman Younus, the internet revolutionised the way business was being done these days. “It has made it easier for people to start a business from home. If you have an idea, you do not need to wait until you get out of college or after graduating from college because there are many sites that can help you get started with your own business,\" he said, pointing out that this was the reason why we are seeing the young generation beginning to earn much earlier compared to previous generations.\n\n“It has made it easier for people to find information about a product or service,” he said.\n\n“This means that instead of having only one source of information, like magazines or newspapers – which sometimes don't cover everything – consumers now have access through various sources such as blogs and social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook,” he added.\n\n“This allows them not just to learn more about something but also give feedback on their thoughts about what should happen next and the companies could improve their products on the basis of the feedback.”\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/internet1597032111-0/internet1597032111-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "US lawmakers unveil bill to help news media negotiate with Google, Facebook", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372714/us-lawmakers-unveil-bill-to-help-news-media-negotiate-with-google-facebook", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 08:59:39 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tA bipartisan group of US lawmakers on Monday released a revised version of a bill aimed at making it easier for news organizations to negotiate collectively with platforms like Google and Facebook.\n\nThe Journalism Competition and Preservation Act \"removes legal obstacles to news organization's ability to negotiate collectively and secure fair terms from gatekeeper platforms that regularly access news content without paying for its value,\" according to a news release from the lawmakers.\n\nThe group includes Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican Senator John Kennedy, both members of the Judiciary Committee, and House Judiciary Committee members David Cicilline, a Democrat, and Ken Buck, a Republican.\n\nA previous version of the bill, introduced in March 2021, was opposed by two technology industry trade groups that Meta Platforms' Facebook and Alphabet's  Google belong to - the Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice.\n\nThe updated bill would cover news publishers with fewer than 1,500 full-time employees and non-network news broadcasters.

Its share price closed up over 5% on the news on Tuesday.\n\nThe talks come as strained Sino-U.S. relations exacerbate sensitivities over technology transfer and data handling across borders, prompting tech firms to reappraise their operations in China. At the same time, there is growing interest in expanding game-making software to new technologies such as the so-called metaverse, an immersive three-dimensional internet.\n\nUnity entered China in 2012 and its eponymous software, known as a game engine, powers many of the country's most popular games such as \"Honor of Kings\" from gaming leader Tencent Holdings Ltd and miHoYo's \"Genshin Impact\".\n\nRivals include Tencent-backed Epic Games, the U.S. developer of the increasingly popular Unreal Engine 5.\n\nUnity's spin-off plan is being driven by a desire to see its software used more extensively in China in areas as varied as smart city modelling to industrial design, as well as in the metaverse, two of the people said. Potential investors Unity has been speaking to have made big bets on the metaverse, they said.\n\nWith China tightening data handling regulations, Unity believes a spin-off would aid this expansion as it would give the unit more local ownership and autonomy over how it operates in the country, which could also increase its attraction to local government and state-owned partners, the people said.\n\nThe spin-off would be one of China's bigger technology deals this year as investment activity has slowed due to weak economic growth, COVID-19 outbreaks and regulatory tightening.\n\nUnity China Chief Executive Zhang Junbo has been working on the plan for at least a year, two of the people said. Progress has been further slowed by Unity's share price sinking 80% since its November 2021 high amid weakness in U.S. tech stocks, and by a product missing performance expectations, they said.\n\nZhang disclosed Unity's China expansion ambition last month to local tech media outlet 36Kr without mentioning a spin-off, saying Unity was exploring ways to make its technology \"safe and controllable\" within China - a reference to the government's mandate for important technology to be controlled domestically.\n\nHe also said Unity would likely hire over a thousand engineers in coming years while expanding offices in Beijing and Guangzhou in addition to its main office in Shanghai.\n\nTwo of the people said Unity's Shanghai-based employees have been asked to sign contracts with the new entity, and that talks about an operating budget separate to its parent's are ongoing.\n\nA local joint venture (JV) could help Unity \"gain a footing with sensitive industries such as governments and manufacturing that are seeking to modernise their operations with digital twins and real-time 3D enabled technologies,\" said Matthew Kanterman, director of research at Ball Metaverse Research Partners.\n\nWhile forming a China JV carries risk - a notable example being a dispute between British chipmaker Arm and its Chinese unit - Kanterman said such JVs have worked well for many Western tech firms, such as HP Inc and Nokia Oyj.\n\n\"Having the right local partners can help Unity succeed where others struggle,\" Kanterman said.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2166077-gaming-1582884808/2166077-gaming-1582884808.jpg"}, {"headline": "Samsung Galaxy S23 could be the most powerful phone ever", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369816/samsung-galaxy-s23-could-be-the-most-powerful-phone-ever", "date_published": "Sat, 06 Aug 22 07:30:22 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSamsung Galaxy S23 could be the most powerful phone ever once it launches next year.

Cyber-terrorists and state-sponsored hackers are the key actors in cyber-war, who not only attack websites to deface them and steal Facebook accounts, but also compromise and destroy our country's economic security.\n\nA malware agent used in a cyberattack for military, paramilitary, or intelligence purposes is usually referred to as a cyberweapon. Data theft and electronic or physical destruction are examples of cyber weapons. While a cyberweapon nearly always causes direct or indirect financial harm to the target organization, direct financial gain for the sponsor is not the primary goal of this type of agent.\n\nA cyber-army is a group of troops with advanced cyber talents who are extremely competent in information technology. Countries should use cyber-armies to maintain national cybersecurity. China is ranked first in cyber defensive power, followed by the Netherlands and France, then the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the United States leads in cyber offensive, cyber norms influence, and cyber intelligence. Teams at Cyber Command are allocated to specific adversaries — including Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China — and have worked with the intelligence community for years to get access to digital networks. Cyberweapons are stealth weapons that, like any computer code, are written in zeros and ones. They have the ability to infiltrate entire networks as well as infect individual PCs. They have the ability to block communication systems, confound enemy signals, and stop military attacks before they happen, all without the flash and bang of traditional weapons of war.\n\nAlthough cyber warfare is a new phenomenon in its current form, the notion is as old as warfare itself. Rivals used to try to physically interrupt their opponent's communication networks in the old days as well. Similarly, using all available means, well-thought-out strategies were used to gain access to information systems and develop mechanisms of misinformation in enemy ranks.\n\nHumans are becoming increasingly reliant on technology due to rapid advancements in communication tool applications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the efficacy of these technical techniques was put to the test. Even the most advanced states with cutting-edge medical facilities were crippled for months, forcing everyone from executives to administrative staff to work digitally from their homes.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of cyber threats has muddled the internal and external dimensions of national security, allowing less powerful state and non-state actors to increase their influence efforts. One of the causes that have fostered the formation of hybrid threats or made irregular warfare more appealing is the shifting nature of traditional ideas of armed conflict and war, because these may not motivate military action.\n\nDue to its great capacity to disrupt communication infrastructure, cyberwarfare is now regarded as a more appropriate tactic for offensive action against a rival. This is particularly risky because it has the potential to immobilize the target system for the duration of the disruption. Highly sensitive defense installations, such as command and control systems, missile-firing sites, air defense systems, and, more importantly, strategic decision-making mechanisms, may be included in these systems.\n\nThe race for space dominance, which began in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik-I by the then-Soviet Union and ended in 1958 with the launch of the United States' first manned space voyage, was perhaps to attain improved connectedness, integration, and networking in the decades to come. However, knowledge gained via advancements in the fields of information and space technology is now being used in a bad way to disrupt the same communication and integration.\n\nState institutions have become increasingly vulnerable as a result of the use of cyber warfare as part of a strategy to disrupt enemy lines of communication and cause harm to their prospective capabilities. Personal security, which is an important component of human security, is also vulnerable to disruptions in communication, location, and financial activities, to name a few examples. As a result, international and national organizations must establish legal procedures to ensure that cyber warfare does not violate an individual's rights or deprive him or her of his or her financial assets. \n\nCyber-warfare tools used by the military could eventually fall into the hands of hackers. According to Interpol Secretary General Jurgen Stock, in a few years, state-developed cyberweapons will be available on the darknet, a hidden area of the internet that cannot be accessed using search engines like Google.\n\n\"In the physical world, that is a significant problem—we have weapons that are used on the battlefield today and will be utilized by organized crime groups tomorrow. The same is true for digital weapons that are currently in use by the military, have been created by the military, and will be available to criminals tomorrow.\"\n\nRansomware, in which hackers lock down a company's computer systems and demand a ransom payment to regain control, is one of the most common cyberweapons. Cyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nCyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Moscow has been blamed for a number of cyberattacks that occurred before and during its military invasion of Ukraine, but it has always denied the allegations. Meanwhile, Ukraine has solicited the assistance of volunteer hackers from all around the world to aid in its defense against Russian aggression. A \"significant number\" of cyberattacks go unnoticed. \"It's not just law enforcement that demands we develop bridges between our silos, the islands of information,\" says the author. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Cybersecurity Outlook study, the number of cyberattacks worldwide more than doubled in 2021. According to the research, ransomware remains the most common sort of assault, with firms being targeted 270 times each year on average. Critical energy infrastructure and supply lines are being jeopardized by cyberattacks. \n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/top-view-unrecognizable-hacker-performing-cyberatt1659791000-0/top-view-unrecognizable-hacker-performing-cyberatt1659791000-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Future Fest founder Arzish Azam represents Pakistan at BSV Global Blockchain Convention in Dubai", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2359364/future-fest-founder-arzish-azam-represents-pakistan-at-bsv-global-blockchain-convention-in-dubai", "date_published": "Tue, 31 May 22 15:40:56 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfter the success of Future Fest 2022 on May 13-15 in Islamaba, Arzish Azam was invited to represent Pakistan as a speaker at BSV Global Blockchain Convention at Grand Hyatt Dubai held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Saud bin Saqr al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council – Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah.\n\nFuture Fest is the largest tech conference of expo of Pakistan, attended by big web3 companies such as Binance, Epic Games, Kucoin, BitOasis and BSV.

This part of Section 497(1) CrPC which prohibits the grant of bail in certain offences is popularly known as the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\"\n\nHowever, the order said that the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC provides that the court may direct that any person under the age of sixteen years or any woman or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be released on bail.\n\nThe expression “such an offence” used in this proviso refers to the offence mentioned in the second part (prohibitory clause) of Section 497(1) CrPC, as for all other non-bailable offences the court is already empowered to release the accused on bail under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nThe first proviso has thus made equal the power of the court to grant bail in the offences of prohibitory clause alleged against an accused under the age of sixteen years, a woman accused and a sick or infirm accused, to its power under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\n\"This means that in cases of women, etc., as mentioned in the first proviso to Section 497(1), irrespective of the category of the offence, bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as an exception in the same manner as it is granted or refused in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nExceptions\n\nThe apex court also noted that the exceptions for refusing bail in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC are therefore also applicable to the accused who pray for bail under the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC in an offence falling within the prohibitory clause.\n\n“These exceptions are well settled by several judgements of this court. They are the likelihood of the accused: (a) to abscond to escape trial; (b) to tamper with the prosecution evidence or influence the prosecution witnesses to obstruct the course of justice; or (c) to repeat the offence keeping in view his previous criminal record, nature of the offence or the desperate manner in which he has prima facie acted in the commission of the offence.\"\n\nRegarding the case in hand, the bench noted that they do not find any material that would attract any of the above exceptions in order to refuse bail to the present petitioner.\n\n\"We are cognizant of the fact that the persons involved in the commission of offences of robbery or dacoity are usually professional criminals and there is a likelihood that they would repeat the offence if enlarged on bail. But the case of the present petitioner is distinguishable as she was working as a maid in the house of the complainant as per his own version, therefore, she does not appear to be a professional robber or dacoit and we do not find a likelihood of her repeating the offence if released on bail.\"\n\n\"The impugned order passed by the high court is, thus, not sustainable under the law and calls for interference by this Court. This petition is, therefore, converted into appeal and the same is allowed: the impugned order is set aside and the petitioner is admitted to post-arrest bail subject to her furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.\"\n\nThe court also noted that concession of bail may be cancelled by the competent court under Section 497(5) CrPC, if the petitioner misuses it in any manner, including causing a delay in the expeditious conclusion of the trial.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/SC1652779579-0/SC1652779579-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "PTI request in Toshakhana reference rejected", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372689/pti-request-in-toshakhana-reference-rejected", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:39:57 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday rejected PTI’s plea to grant a three-week time to provide documents in the reference seeking disqualification of party chief Imran Khan for not sharing details of Toshakhana gifts, directing it to submit the same within a week.\n\nPTI chief Imran Khan’s counsel Barrister Gohar appeared before the ECP on Monday as a five-member commission headed by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja heard the reference.\n\nBarrister Khalid Ishaq appeared before the bench on behalf of the coalition government while petitioner Mohsin Nawaz Ranjha represented PML-N.\n\nAt the outset of the hearing, the PTI counsel insisted that the party needed at least three weeks to gather and furnish the documents relating to the declaration of assets.\n\n“We are reviewing whether someone has declared iPhone and watches in his assets declaration or not,” the counsel told the bench.\n\nHe further explained that since the ECP had to wrap up the case in three months, the party would rather submit its answer in tandem with another in a similar reference seeking Imran's disqualification.\n\nAt this, the CEC remarked that the PTI would nonetheless still have the documents disclosed in the ECP's report.\n\nHowever, Barrister Gohar Khan contended that PML-N's petitioner Mohsin Nawaz Ranjha should also submit the statements pertaining to his party's declaration of assets.\n\nChiming in, the petitioner replied that the failure of other parties to disclose their assets did not provide Imran Khan \"a licence to his assets\".\n\nThe hearing was then adjourned until August 29.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/ECP1640860350-0/ECP1640860350-0.jpeg"}, {"headline": "Lahore to Quetta train service suspended", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372688/lahore-to-quetta-train-service-suspended", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:39:32 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Pakistan Railways has suspended the train service between Sindh and Balochistan for the next two to three days, as rains and flash floods have inundated railway tracks and damaged bridges, officials said on Monday.\n\n“Our tracks and yards have been affected in Sindh and Balochistan due to heavy rains.

Likewise, when the FIR is registered then the court should also initiate a contempt proceedings or not.\n\nThe Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday decided to initiate contempt proceedings against Imran Khan for passing controversial remarks regarding female sessions court judge Zeba Chaudhry.\n\nAt a rally in Islamabad’s F-9 park on Saturday, Imran had threatened to file cases against Islamabad’s inspector general (IG) of police and deputy inspector general (DIG) of police and declared: “We won’t spare you.” He then warned the judiciary against its “biased” attitude towards his party, saying that it should brace itself for the consequences.\n\nThis is not the first time the court is taking up a contempt matter against Imran. However, the PTI chief has managed to secure relief in such cases.\n\nIn 2013, the top court had summoned cricketer-turned-politician Imran for a contempt hearing over his \"critical and derogatory\" remarks against the judiciary.\n\nImran, who had by then made a major breakthrough in the general election, had allegedly said that the polls were rigged and criticised the judiciary and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not taking notice.\n\n\"While holding press conference on 26.7.2013, he (Khan) stated that the role of judiciary and Election Commission of Pakistan is shameful in the conduct of general elections; that the elections were rigged, due to role played by these two institutions,\" the apex court’s notice read.\n\nHowever, in a major relief for Imran, the Supreme Court decided to drop contempt proceedings on the suggestion of the then attorney general for Pakistan Muneer A Malik.\n\nA three-member bench headed by Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali discharged the notice after hearing the arguments of AGP Munir in the case who said that it is not the matter of disobedience.\n\nThe judgment said that admittedly, Imran Khan is a public figure and duly elected member of the National Assembly who has not only been actively involved in politics for a considerable period, but also heads a political party.\n\n\"In such circumstances, while considering his conduct, we also cannot lose sight of the provision of Articles-19 and 66 of our Constitution, relating to freedom of speech and the privileges of members of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament).”\n\n\"Thus, at this juncture, as a note of caution, we may observe that politicians and other public figures having their say and a following amongst the public are expected to use more decent and guarded language and have to be more careful in the selection of words in public gatherings or press conferences so as to show their intellect, maturity of mind and wisdom qua respect to various national institutions, and to present themselves as role models for the society at large,” the judgement noted.\n\nSimilarly, earlier this year, the Supreme Court refused to initiate contempt proceedings against the PTI chief over the non-implementation of its May 25 order.\n\nThe apex court had issued clear instructions to hold its Azadi March protest near Peshawar Mor between the H-9 and G-9 areas of Islamabad. However, Imran and his protestors did make their way toward D-Chowk, prompting the government to call in the Pakistan Army for the security of the capital's Red Zone.\n\nThe apex court had formed a five-member larger bench, headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, to hear the application filed by Attorney General of Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf.\n\nHowever, SC Judge Justice Yahya Afridi, while dissenting with the majority order, observed that a contempt proceeding should be initiated against PTI chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan for instructing party activists and supporters to proceed toward D-Chowk in violation of the SC's May 25 order.\n\nHe noted that there was sufficient material before the SC to initiate a contempt proceeding against Imran Khan over violation of the May 25 order and instructed the party activists and supporters to proceed toward D-Chowk.\n\nHowever, instead of issuing a contempt notice, the majority judges on June 1 sought reports from director generals of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) as well as Islamabad IG police, interior secretary and others over the alleged involvement of PTI leaders in instigating party workers to reach Islamabad's D-Chowk in violation of its May 25 order.\n\nLater the court was apprised by the law enforcement agencies that a “crowd was organised to enter Red Zone under the PTI leadership who had reached Express Chowk with the intent to proceed further towards D-Chowk as per the directions of the party’s highest command”.\n\nThe matter is still pending in the apex court.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/court-hammer1658069967-0/court-hammer1658069967-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Administrative issues jack up NHA project costs", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372681/administrative-issues-jack-up-nha-project-costs", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:15:58 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe cost of 33 National Highway Authority (NHA) projects has increased from Rs79.5 billion in 2008 to Rs90.73 billion in 2021 due to non-availability of funds and delay in land acquisition.\n\nAccording to the documents available with The Express Tribune, between 2008 and 2021, 33 projects of the authority were completed at cost overruns.

My enthusiasm was further bolstered by the welcome board en route to Makkah which stated “Guests of Ar-Rahman, your safety is our responsibility”.\n\n\n\nOn July 7th, I joined the one million pilgrims – 1.5 million less than in 2019 – in Minna. This was the largest Hajj gathering since the pandemic had forced numbers to 10,000 Muslims in 2020 and 60,000 Muslims in 2021. Suffice to say, all eyes were on the Kingdom. This year’s Hajj also coincided with 100 years of Saudi Arabia’s organising of the annual pilgrimage. Hajj 1443 was made all the more special since it coincided with a Friday, making it Hajj-e-Akbar.\n\n\n\nCompared to my previous experience, the zeal among the pilgrims seemed somewhat diminished. At first, I believed these to be misapprehensions given the reduced numbers. However, increased interaction with my companions made me realise that the pandemic, circumventing all biases, had been hard on everyone regardless of stature. Without a doubt, Covid-19 has broken each and every one of us in some way. The white barrier between the Kabbah and pilgrims was a reinforcing testament to the ‘new normal’ we have all been forced to adopt.\n\n\n\nFrom my past encounters, I was on the lookout for miracles. And I was not disappointed. A friend had related that the people of Makkah claim that clouds provide shade to the Hujjaj. I witnessed this first hand on the Day of Arafat – considered the apex of Hajj – during which unexpected clouds started forming in a previously clear sky, thereby making it tolerable to sit outside in the 44-degree heat. The same happened during the rest of the pilgrimage days. Each ritual reaffirmed what I had grown up hearing: “Hajj sabr ka naam hai” (Hajj is the name of patience), which further reinforces the South African phrase “Umuntu Ngumuntu Ngabantu” (I am because of what we all are). This feeling, I believe now, is a miracle in itself.\n\n\n\nIn line with their Vision 2030, this year, the Kingdom had undertaken many experiments and introduced many changes, with mixed results. A major issue was for those journeying from America, Europe and Australia who had to apply for Hajj using an online portal. There was a lack of clarity in the draw process and mix ups, as a result of which, many people were turned back from the airport.\n\nHowever, this is not to take away from the many improvements I witnessed. In keeping with their national rejuvenation plans, the Saudis had increased the application of modern technology by harnessing the best electronic devices available. This included the “In your languages, we welcome you” campaign, which aims at guiding the pilgrims in 23 languages. This highlighted increased inclusivity and accommodation of pilgrims which I had previously not witnessed.\n\n\n\nA robot introduced in the Grand Mosque, Makkah to distribute Qurans to worshipers.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable sights for me was to see Hajjis zooming along on electric scooters. As a trial service, the Saudi Public Authority for Transport provided pilgrims with this service to help ease the time taken between Holy sites. For instance, the usually one-hour walk between Arafat to Muzdalifah was reduced to just 15 minutes. This is in addition to the Saudi Hajj Ministry’s adoption of smart technologies to help assure comfort of the Hajjis.\n\n\n\nBy the same token, there were visibly increased numbers of security officials and scouts to aid the pilgrims not only during the rituals but also in and around the Holy Mosques. Another marked change was the greater role of the youth in all areas of pilgrim assistance; be it spraying water on the pilgrims to provide relief from the heat or medics and security personnel.\n\nSimilarly, even though on previous visits I had noticed the expanding role of women in workplaces in the country, this time around it was very distinct. Now there were uniformed women officers inside the Mosque, women volunteers at the airport and even women administering passenger data input. These tasks had previously been reserved for men alone.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, after a two year international hiatus, Hajj 1443 was a success and a triumph for the Muslim ummah in the face of the trials and tribulations brought on by the pandemic. Restored, refreshed and recentered, I departed Madina airport, leaving a part of my soul in Makkah and a piece of my heart in the Prophet’s (PBUH) city.\n\n\nAll photos courtesy of the author.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1081507-HajjTawafKaabaAFP-1460156940/1081507-HajjTawafKaabaAFP-1460156940.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan and Iran: The potential for a great alliance", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97602/pakistan-and-iran-the-potential-for-a-great-alliance", "date_published": "Wed, 22 Jun 22 08:36:24 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMarred by sectarian violence, opposing interests, differing foreign policies and failed economic possibilities, Pakistan-Iran relations have soured throughout the years. As a result, Islamabad has seldom explored the possibility of deeper relations with its western neighbour.\n\nAlthough Pakistan and Iran co-operate on a multitude of different platforms and sectors, the degree of cooperation has often been tested, and a considerable amount of blame for this falls on Pakistan’s shoulders. Shackled by its external constraints, primarily in the form of American influence, the risk of Saudi alienation, and the sanctions on Iran, Pakistan has consistently remained reluctant to pursue deeper relations. Iran, on the other hand, has shown a willingness to strengthen bilateral ties, the chief example being the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline. Islamabad’s lack of interest has not gone unnoticed in Tehran.\n\nIndignant about Pakistan’s ambivalent foreign policy, Iran has sought a closer relationship with India, which has proven to be a resourceful and trustworthy partner. In direct competition with Pakistan’s Gwadar port, Indian support helped Iran mobilise Chabahar as a major oceanic port in the region. Furthermore, Indian influence in Iran has helped India to indirectly meet its nefarious interests against Pakistan, particularly vis-a-vis Balochistan and Southern Afghanistan. As a result, Islamabad’s lack of interest in seeking a meaningful relationship with Iran has weakened its overall influence and created a region where Pakistan is becoming increasingly cornered.\n\nHowever, the obstacles which once sought to hinder Pak-Iran relations are now beginning to wither away, paving the way for a potentially great alliance.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Pakistan faces when it comes to Iran is pressure from its ally, the United States (US). America has been explicitly vocal against any form of cooperation between Iran and Pakistan, and it is no secret that it has sabotaged numerous initiatives between the two nations. However, following the war in Ukraine, America has had a change of heart. With the threat of a severe energy crisis inexorably hitting the developed and developing world, America has confronted the situation by re-engaging with countries that it once had vowed to eschew.\n\nIn March 2022, after years of estrangement, a senior American delegation had a rare face-to-face meeting with the Nicolas Maduro government in Caracas, Venezuela, the world’s most oil-rich country. The meeting had a one-point agenda: replace Russian oil with Venezuelan oil. Similar energy-focused engagements with Libya have also been undertaken by the US. More interestingly, the Biden administration has felt the JCPOA agreement (Iran Nuclear Deal) should be revived to relieve Iran of its sanctions and benefit from its abundant gas and oil supplies. Talks in Vienna are already underway and major headway is being made, highlighting the possibility that a deal could once again be struck.\n\nAmerica’s change in position is driven purely out of necessity for its own self-interest; however, with no end in sight in Ukraine, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US is adopting softer attitudes toward its oil-rich adversaries, in particular Iran. For Pakistan, this is a now or never opportunity: capitalise on the west’s relaxation now and secure deals with Iran or delay the opportunity and ultimately face the wrath of the west.\n\nAnother hurdle Pakistan faces when it comes to Iran is the Saudi Arabian question. Any venture with Iran risks the upsetting of ‘brotherly’ Saudi Arabia, and although Pakistan has remained explicitly neutral in the pair’s cold war – through the training, support, and cooperation with its armed forces – it is clear that Islamabad indirectly sides with Riyadh. As a result, Pakistan’s alliance with the Saudis bars it from exploring real terms with Iran.\n\nIn the past year, however, there have been growing signs of rapprochement between the two arch rivals. Through the meditation of Iraq and Oman, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been willing to sit at the peace table and are now engaging in their fifth round of direct talks. Furthermore, with the cessation of hostilities in Yemen as well as the re-opening of the Iranian representative office in the OIC, analysts are hopeful that the two countries are finally coming to some form of an agreement, and the possibility of re-establishing diplomatic missions is not too far fetched.\n\nAs for Pakistani gains in light of such developments, they are significant. Not only can Islamabad now engage peacefully with Tehran, without alienating Saudi Arabia, but it can also facilitate further reconciliation between the two countries and emerge as a key mediator of peace in the region.\n\nWith the roadblocks to cooperation finally lifting, Pakistan and Iran can pave the way for a great alliance. This alliance can take two forms, one of an economic dimension and the other of a non-economic one. However, the beauty of a Pak-Iran alliance is not in its business prospective nor the cultural linkages but in the fact that it is mutually beneficial. At home, both Iran and Pakistan face pressing issues of different kinds, yet both sides can help each other solve their respective problems.\n\nThe major cornerstone of Pak-Iran relations has been the proposed Pakistan-Iran (IP) gas pipeline, a proposition which can mutually benefit both sides simultaneously. Stretching from South Pars all the way to Punjab, the 1900km pipeline would provide inestimable value for both Pakistan and Iran. As it currently stands, however, the IP gas pipeline is an opportunity fading away. Despite the project’s inception nearly a decade ago, the pipeline has yet to even start. Iran’s side of the pipeline is built but has simply been left to rust, while Pakistan’s side is waiting to start construction.\n\nThe causes of Pakistan’s lack of initiative is due to the abovementioned external pressure coupled with internal distrust, leading to the project’s early abandonment. However, this can all change. As stated before, Iran’s rapidly changing geopolitical image, as well as the easing of Pakistani challenges vis-a-vis foreign policy could usher in a new wave of enthusiasm. The IP gas pipeline could finally restart and ultimately benefit the two countries immensely.\n\nPlagued with severe energy shortages, depleting indigenous sources and inchoate industries, Pakistan is on the brink of energy starvation. So far, loans and expensive imports have kept the energy sector afloat, but these are short-term solutions and are unsustainable in the long run. As for local energy sources within the country, they too have proven insufficient.\n\nUltimately, Pakistan will need to increase its imported energy, preferably at cheap and subsidised rates. Once revived, however, the IP gas pipeline can solve the majority of these problems. Providing 22 million cubic metres of gas a day, and electricity generation equivalent to nearly 4,500 megawatts, the pipeline would be able to meet nearly all of Pakistan’s current electricity shortfall. Furthermore, compared to its current import from countries such as Qatar, Iranian LNG is far more affordable.\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, the IP gas pipeline can cement Pak-Iran relations and effectively thwart expanding Indian influence in the region. What’s more interesting is that in 2016, China expressed the desire to invest in the pipeline and expand it into its own borders. Iran welcomed Chinese interest and sweetened the deal by expressing interest in joining the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). If Iran joins, an unparalleled trifecta in the region could emerge, hence promoting development, peace and stability. Although it is too early to tell right now, initial willingness from different countries has shown that the IP gas pipeline could be a catalyst for extraordinary cooperation in the region and beyond.\n\nFor Iran, the IP gas pipeline could provide much-needed relief to its ailing economy. Crippled by years of brutal sanctions, Iran has failed to effectively monetise its abundant oil and gas supplies, and as a result, has suffered from abysmally low GDP figures. Notably absent from LNG and oil markets, Iran is missing out and is eager to establish itself as a force in the economic world. Moreover, Iran has lacked an iron brother-like alliance with any of its neighbours to assist in alleviating its crises. For example, Iraq is embroiled in constant turmoil and lacks stability for any strong alliance to emerge, while neighbours in the Caucasus do not see eye-to-eye with Iran. However, an economic alliance with Pakistan is not only stable and safe, but the market of 220 million people can provide ample opportunity for Iran to fulfil its economic needs.\n\nOver the past decades, an environment of trepidation and apprehension has developed in place of a potentially fraternal relationship between Pakistan and Iran. The two countries have continually looked away from one another, opting to search thousands of miles away for rather unsustainable and short-lived alliances. However, as Pakistan and Iran unshackle themselves from the constraints of geopolitics, they must look towards one another for a better future.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/image1654671439-0/image1654671439-0.png"}, {"headline": "Does gun control even matter to GOP members and the NRA?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97595/does-gun-control-even-matter-to-gop-members-and-the-nra", "date_published": "Tue, 07 Jun 22 11:29:25 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMass shootings are gaining renewed momentum across the United States (US) in light of the Texas school shooting and Memorial Day gun violence in Chicago. The former incident is said to be the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook. These are just a few instances of gun violence that get plastered all over the news, and rightfully so.\n\nAccording to Gun Violence Archive, there have been at least 246 mass shootings in the US so far this year, far more than the number of days passed in 2022. More than 2,000 American teenagers between the ages 12 to 17 have been shot dead or injured this year. There have been 8,346 gun-related deaths, 15,768 injuries and 634 unintentional shootings. Moreover, 473 children between ages zero to 11 years were shot during the first half of this year. What also appears to be gripping parts of the US are imitation mass murders. Following the Memorial Day shootings, there have been 13 others this past weekend, leaving more than a dozen dead and at least 70 injured. Gun violence is an act of terrorism that is encouraging repressed individuals to come forward and commit crimes openly.\n\nIt is critical to consider the complexity of America’s gun violence epidemic. Although mass shooters target innocent civilians at large, people kill in self-defense; they also commit suicide using weapons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2020, 54% of all gun-related deaths in the US were suicides (24,292). Therefore, gun violence should never be equated to mass shootings alone. The issue is more nuanced than we think.\n\nTake for instance the Covid-19 pandemic. It caused 45,000 deaths (suicide or homicide) by guns. These deaths can be partly attributed to loss of jobs, psychological strain and exacerbated mental illness that Americans experienced in 2020.\n\nThat said, gun violence in America continues to take an emotional toll on families, while gun advocates observe in silence. Gun advocacy is a big part of the problem to push for safer, smarter gun control measures. A vocal proponent of guns is Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who signed seven laws, making it easier for people to access guns, including individuals over 21 who can carry a handgun without license and training. Easier access to guns caused gun violence to soar in Texas, which has one of the highest numbers of mass shootings in the US. Last year, Texas saw a 65% increase in mass shootings.\n\nOn top of gun advocates and GOP (republican party) members backing their second amendment rights, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has an equally important role to play in politicising gun control. It is no surprise that the NRA uses funds to push its agenda forward, which is to support guns left-right-centre. They use heaps of money to sway the debate surrounding gun control in their favour. Numerous Republicans⁠, Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, Mitch McConnell, and a dozen others have benefited from the NRA in the past, including a law firm that has backed the association for years in exchange of $23 million.\n\nIn the wake of deadly mass shootings, it is unfathomable that the NRA would hold its annual meeting days after the Robb Elementary School massacre. This insensitive move demonstrates the NRA’s audacity to push for gun rights in a time when thousands of families grieve the loss of their loved ones. The association claims that it is “committed to making schools secure” but it is only in the guise of hypocrisy.\n\nAlthough democrat states including New York and California are making concerted efforts to counter gun violence through bills and gun buyback programs, these efforts will never budge GOP members. Schools, colleges, theaters and bars will continue to be targets of mass shootings because second amendment rights hold more value than human life in Republican states.\n\nSo, where is the middle ground if there is no solution to gun control at all? The key is to keep gun laws intact but changing the eligibility criteria of who qualifies to own a gun. A person with a history of mental illness should never have access to guns. This begs the question: how do you know someone is mentally unfit to own a gun? That is where running thorough background checks comes into play. These background checks can help curb a potential mass shooter from committing mass murder.\n\nIn addition, the legal age to own a gun should be raised from 18 years to at least 21. Right now, individuals 18 and older can be sold long guns, which is alarming given that two 18 year-olds were responsible for the deadliest school shootings in America (Sandy Hook and the recent Robb Elementary School shootings). Countries such as Norway, Canada, New Zealand and Australia managed to curb gun violence through smart gun laws. The rate of mass shootings has sharply declined in these countries. Perhaps the US should extract valuable lessons and parallel similar gun reform strategies, if not exactly the same.\n\nThe media plays a very essential role to get the word about gun control out to the public. If media agencies including digital, print and broadcast, set aside their political differences and harmonise to address gun violence and gun control, things can steer in the right direction. Media coverage of mass shootings across the country can raise more alarm about gun violence in America, which can lead to protests, political pressure and ultimately, some form of resolution.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/OHKOJWUK2FLT7FEKYXS47ABT3I1653551321-0/OHKOJWUK2FLT7FEKYXS47ABT3I1653551321-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Why developing countries should not reduce their reliance on fossil fuels", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97593/why-developing-countries-should-not-reduce-their-reliance-on-fossil-fuels", "date_published": "Fri, 03 Jun 22 09:57:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn just 24 days in 2022, an average American had produced more carbon than an average Pakistani would produce in the whole year. In just three days, an average Australian emits more carbon dioxide than his counterpart would do in the whole year in Niger. The video gaming industry in the United States (US) consumes more electricity than any country in Africa. Of the total 1.5 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere since the middle of the 18th century, 70 per cent has been produced by the US, China, Europe and Russia, with the US being the largest emitter by far. \n\nThese are some of the facts that reflect a wide gap between posturing by the rich countries of the world of being considerate of the environment and the deplorable ground reality.\n\nThe richest countries are home to half of the world’s population and emit 86 per cent of the world’s total carbon dioxide emissions. If we are to improve the climate and limit global heating to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, carbon emissions have to be curbed and more action is required from the rich and developed countries. Many in the developing world are of the opinion that the global north has already benefited from fossil fuels and now that it has all the means and resources to shift to cleaner energy, it is imposing the same on the global south where people are yet to attain a higher standard of living. Critical energy projects for less economically developed countries are being banned under the garb of environmental conservation.\n\nAt the 26th Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) held in 2021, more than 20 countries – including the US and some European nations – pledged to stop foreign fossil fuel financing while giving no indication of curbing their domestic production and expansion. Such two-faced actions do more harm than good: one, by pushing poor countries further to the brink; and two, by making a mockery of environmentalism and snatching away its true spirit and purpose.\n\nIn a similar move, China announced last year that it won’t build new coal-fired power plants abroad. China has been the major contributor to Pakistan’s coal-powered energy sector in the recent past. Pakistan has total coal reserves of more than 185 billion tonnes and ranks seventh among the countries with the largest lignite coal reserves. These reserves can ensure sustainable development by keeping the economic and social pillars of sustainability intact through empowerment, improved well-being and availability of opportunities for the present and future generations.\n\nDepriving the developing world of growth and development by curbing the supply of fossil fuels or by halting investments in fossil-generated energy projects will deteriorate beleaguered economies. It is important that the global south be allowed to follow the same path to development as the global north took, that is, by ensuring development through industrialisation, even if it came through the use of fossil fuels. Economic prosperity will, in fact, enable the availability of necessary resources and capital to protect another pillar of sustainability – the environment. This doesn’t mean that development will necessarily come at the expense of the environment. Environmentally-friendly fuel to energy conversion technologies can be used to mitigate harmful environmental impacts. Instead of curbing the funding of fossil-generated energy projects, the richer countries should invest in the use of less harmful methods of energy generation through fossil fuels.\n\nReadily available and economically viable energy options are the need of the hour for many developing countries like Pakistan, without which the achievement of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will remain a distant dream.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1080201-SmokestackinChinaCarbonemissionsAFPxx-1459978271/1080201-SmokestackinChinaCarbonemissionsAFPxx-1459978271.jpg"}, {"headline": "It’s not about being pro-abortion, it’s about being pro-choice", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97578/its-not-about-being-pro-abortion-its-about-being-pro-choice", "date_published": "Sat, 07 May 22 10:24:08 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSome interesting developments (or lack thereof) have surfaced about the abortion laws in the United States (US). Feminists who fought long and hard for a woman’s right to choose are turning in their graves after discovering that Justice Samuel Alito is considering overturning a landmark decision in the case of Roe v Wade, which sought to protect abortion rights in the US almost 50 years ago. An initial draft of the said move has been leaked. Even though this leaked draft is not the final verdict or opinion of the court, it has however sparked a serious wave of reactions and disappointment from abortion rights advocates. If the final call reflects the opinion draft, America will see a drastic shift regarding abortion rights in the country.\n\nFor anyone not already familiar with the original Roe v Wade, here is a quick description and a somewhat lengthy explanation about its significance for women’s rights. A landmark decision was taken in 1973 by the US Supreme Court that ruled that the Constitution of the US protected women’s liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restrictions. This decision ultimately opened up safe spaces and clinics for women who wished to have abortions done, with services provided by fully trained and licensed physicians. The decision ultimately explained that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution provides “a right to privacy” which protects a pregnant woman’s rights to choose. Furthermore, the court reasoned those outlawing abortions would violate a pregnant woman’s right to privacy for reasons such as:\n\n\n\thaving unwanted children would lead to a distressful life and future for the woman;\n\tit may cause long-term psychological harm which could result in poor care of the child considering the mother’s weak physical and mental health;\n\tand because there may be “distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child”.\n\n\nThe decision was celebrated by abortion rights advocates as this was a huge move towards recognising women’s rights when it came to making their own choices about their bodies. And why shouldn’t it be? The benefits of legalised abortion are plentiful – fewer illegitimate births, smaller welfare costs, less children born as a result of rape. However, according to Alito, the constitution makes no such reference to abortion and that no such right is implicitly protected by the constitutional provision.\n\nTherefore, the overturning of Roe v Wade would lead to stricter limits on abortion access largely in the South and Midwest, with about half of the states set to immediately enforce broad abortion bans. On the other hand, the following 16 states have laws in place to protect the right to abortion: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\n\nWhy this debate is causing such an uproar is not only because this is overall a huge setback for women’s right to choose what they want to do with their bodies but also the deep negative impact the ban will have (if implemented) on women who are prevented from obtaining abortions. Some of these adverse consequences include mental, physical and financial impacts. It has been proven in several studies that being denied an abortion is linked with an increase in anxiety, stress and lower self-esteem shortly after the denial. Women who are denied abortions also experience financial hardship, including an increase in household poverty considering there are additional mouths to feed and there are no strict laws around having the biological father provide child care support.\n\nIf abortion is to be banned and women’s bodies are to be controlled by a bunch of old white men, then perhaps they should also consider the consequences this will have on those very women, especially rape victims who have to carry the child of their abuser for nine months and then live with that trauma forever; while also being at risk of being contacted by the rapist for child custody or continued sexual violence and harassment. The ban would also greatly impact teenage mothers, sex workers and/or those women who become pregnant in cases of premarital and extramarital affairs. The fear of raising the child alone and being financially incapable of raising the child are of the top most reasons of pregnancy termination. Another very common reason for terminating a pregnancy is known as “young age pregnancy”, which ultimately would affect the young girl’s life negatively, while restricting her mobility and opportunities. Why is it that controlling women’s bodies and hindering their bodily autonomy is always up for debate, yet men’s accountability is hardly ever spoken about?\n\nA better draft opinion to read about would’ve been the US Supreme Court leaning towards providing free vasectomies for men. It’s a fairly painless and reversible process which does not cause any kind of long-term psychological or physical ailments. If men who get women pregnant can ‘choose’ not be part of the raising process, they should be encouraged to undergo the medical procedure so as to not cause pregnancies at all. The procedure can be reversed if and when they decide to have children consensually with their partner. But of course, restricting men’s bodily autonomy would be of the utmost disgrace and disrespect.\n\nAccording to Alito’s draft opinion, the idea that the abortion bans reflect the subjugation of women in American society is wrong considering women still have electoral and political power. By this logic, if women possess the right to vote or hold a public position, they should completely give up the right to decide what they want to do with their bodies because a few people who don’t even have a uterus can feel important about themselves. I wonder if these people who have decided to put these rights up for debates in the first place have even researched about the topic at all. It is actually quite obvious that despite the bans on abortions, they will continue to take place, only they will be unsafe and painful ones. Post-abortion care is essential for addressing disabilities caused by induced or self-induced abortions because they can surely be taken care of. However, the likelihood of women having access to post-abortion care and services will be practically zero in the states where the ban is to be implemented.\n\nThe US claims to be a superpower leading the world with its impeccable score on all fronts as a nation, but ironically their conservative ideas around minority rights have always remained questionable. These abortion laws are no different. Abortion is a reality, which is why it is essential that women be provided with affordable and easily accessible services without any pre-conceived notions and biases. The right to choose is a fundamental one and courts should challenge their abortion laws instead of executing bans that are only an attack on women’s freedom. If there is a ban which needs to be implemented immediately it is America’s gun laws which take more lives than abortions, with conviction rates of criminals at a disappointingly low rate, especially if the shooter is described as a white male. Pro-life advocates who are for the ban need to rethink their priorities and direct their energy into making more sensible arguments and fight for the justice of innocent children and adults who have been killed during school hours or in movie theatres by white American men who have the freedom to legally obtain a weapon over the counter, that too without a license or any understandable reason.\n\nThis is not about being pro-abortion, this is about being pro-choice, that no matter what your personal feelings or beliefs about abortion are, you understand it is not your place to make a decision for another woman about what she can and cannot do with her body.\n\nTo know where Pakistan stands on abortion laws, you can read my detailed piece here.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651920521-0/Cover1651920521-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Follow Riasat-e-Medina in Pakistan but not in Medina itself", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97576/follow-riasat-e-medina-in-pakistan-but-not-in-medina-itself", "date_published": "Sat, 30 Apr 22 10:01:34 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tYou know things have truly gone down the drain when local politics in Pakistan is unnecessarily taken out of context, literally, and used as a sorry excuse to spread hatred, ignorance, violence and blatant sexism. In the most recent case of embarrassing and shameful events, supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) went ahead and created complete havoc at Masjid-e-Nabawi without thinking twice about the historical and religious importance of the very ground they stood on.\n\nIn case they forgot, here is a quick reminder: Masjid-e-Nabawi is one of the most sacred places in Medina for Muslims. Considering Pakistanis have self-appointed themselves as the sole protectors of Islam for so long by protecting and defending blasphemy laws in the hope of punishing (even if wrongly) those who apparently disrespect Islam, this very act in Medina has proved that nothing – not even a place of worship during one of the holiest months for Muslims – can stop these devils from showing their true colours.\n\nThere is a nasty video being circulated on social media showing a bunch of men chanting slogans of “chor, chor” (thieves) at some members of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s delegation in Medina. Not only that, it is clearly visible and audible the highly disrespectful and profane language and slogans being hurled at the current Federal Minister of Information and Broadcasting Maryam Aurangzeb. Using disrespectful and disconcerting sexist slogans against women is so outdated but, since a patriarchal induced understanding of gender and culture plagues this country so deeply, this is hardly a surprise. Degrading and violating women has long been used as a tool and indicator of victory in wars, and this, it seems, is no different – especially since Imran Khan keeps comparing this whole political escapade to the battle of Karbala.\n\nThe harassment faced by various members of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) while performing their religious duties has raised eyebrows across the globe as Pakistanis are yet again being highlighted for their deranged actions. The sanctity of the holy mosque has been spoiled and there is no justification for carrying out dirty political agendas on holy sites.\n\nAs if the political garbage that we’re witnessing first-hand in Pakistan wasn’t enough, we are now a mere laughing spectacle for those nations whom we have tried to convince otherwise in the hopes of building amicable relations. As if our perceived association with terrorism wasn’t enough, this has added another feather to our embarrassment cap. If Imran set out to create a Riasat-e-Medina in Pakistan, perhaps he should give sermons to his followers on how to effectively follow the rules of Medina in Medina at the very least. It’s obvious that pre-planning this stunt did not go the way he wished. Sadly, and evidently, this cult mentality has brought politically blinded citizens to a point where they see nothing wrong with what they did. Many have not even bothered to condemn this awful incident, and the rest are still finding ways to justify it.\n\nYes, every citizen of a country should be well-aware and critical of the politics of their country and should be able to question their leaders whenever they see irregularities, injustices and/or discrimination taking place. But to be politically charged to this extent is very dangerous since some Pakistanis will export their violent and extremist attitudes to the countries which have allowed them in, further causing global isolation. These actions are mostly perpetuated by men, and usually women have to pay the price. But alas, when a so-called leader openly supports sexual harassers and believes in victim-shaming, one can hardly expect any wise, well-thought out and grounded decision-making.\n\nI am amazed at how effortlessly all of this has been planned and implemented. This particular incident reeks of misogyny and hypocrisy at all levels. It is obvious that this will destabilise and polarise the nation further, and will make violence an acceptable form of ‘protest’. The common saying “politics can be dirty” is an understatement in the case of Pakistan. Our politics is not only ours, it’s for the entire world to find entertainment in. But, more importantly, it is a disgrace to the religion we hold so dear.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651313943-0/Cover1651313943-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Are we on the brink of a global recession?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97575/are-we-on-the-brink-of-a-global-recession", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Apr 22 08:21:09 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSince Covid-19 brought the world to a halt in 2020, life has been nothing short of a nightmare. We have already seen unprecedented national lockdowns, social distancing measures, overburdened hospitals, and mass casualties all over the world. However, with the introduction of vaccinations, we assumed the horror was finally over, but nothing could be farther from the truth. With inflation on the rise, widespread supply chain bottlenecks, and rising geopolitical tensions, governments face a monumental task in steering their countries away from a crisis. Looking at the current global situation, it is clear that we are in deep waters and may be on the verge of a global recession.\n\nWith economies all over the world reopening and consumers returning to markets, the main issue that central banks are dealing with is rising consumer prices. To combat inflation from rising any further, central banks started winding down their quantitative easing measures put in place at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, these measures were rendered ineffective due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which exacerbated global supply chains and drove commodity prices to historic highs, adding fuel to the already raging fire.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict has been detrimental to oil and gas prices, which have risen sharply. Furthermore, the two countries are large exporters of agricultural commodities, and account for nearly 14% of global wheat trade. Similarly, Russia and Ukraine account for nearly 19% of global barley exports and nearly 52% of global sunflower oil exports.\n\nIt is also important to note that, because Russia is a major fertiliser exporter, sanctions against the country could have a negative impact on fertiliser supply around the world, lowering crop yields. Russia is also a major supplier of valuable minerals such as palladium, titanium, nickel, and neon. Palladium, in particular, is a critical component in automobile manufacturing, and its price has increased astronomically since the war began. Supply disruptions in these commodities from Russia and Ukraine have driven up consumer prices even further.\n\nAside from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, China’s zero-Covid policy is causing mayhem in commodity supplies all over the world. The imposition of strict lockdowns and travel restrictions is harming demand and economic growth in the world's second-largest economy. Shanghai, the world’s busiest container port, is closed due to an uptick in coronavirus infections in the region. As a result, hundreds of cargo ships have been stranded in the port.\n\nMoving forward, China's return to a Covid-zero state is highly unlikely given the likelihood of new coronavirus variants emerging in the future. As a result, the global economy is predicted to stay under pressure, at least in the short term, and inflation is expected to continue its upward trend, forcing central banks to continue hiking interest rates until the global macroeconomic outlook stabilises.\n\nConsequently, given the Russia-Ukraine war and the slowing down of China’s economy, policymakers around the world are considering the likelihood of the global economy entering into a recession. According to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the growth of the global economy will drop to 2.8% in 2022. Earlier, it had predicted that the global economy would expand by nearly 4.1% before Russia declared war on Ukraine. Similarly, as per WoodMac, a research and consultancy company, the global economy is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2022 and 0.7% in 2023.\n\nInvestors around the world are already tweaking their strategies and becoming more cautious as uncertainty in global markets continues to rise. This is clear from the inversion of the American Treasury yield curve, which indicates that investors are shifting away from risky equities and towards short-term fixed income bonds in an attempt to protect themselves from the possibility of the global economy slowing down in the short term. Furthermore, fund managers around the world are also increasing the weightage of cash in their portfolios.\n\nConsidering the aforementioned warning signs such as rising inflation, inversion of the American treasury yield curve, and portfolio reallocation by global fund managers, the likelihood of the global economy entering a recession in the short term is high. Hence, countries are at a critical juncture where policymakers must be proactive in dealing with the looming issues, and governments should be actively seeking for ways to protect their respective countries from the implications of a global recession.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651134728-0/Cover1651134728-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "From India to Bharat", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97566/from-india-to-bharat", "date_published": "Wed, 06 Apr 22 10:18:47 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIf centuries of plunder in the subcontinent, communal rifts and destructive power struggles were someone’s fault, whose were they? Were they ours? Was it theirs? I’m still searching for the answers but what I do know is that our past divided us then and it continues to divide us now. The fact that Narendra Modi’s India is a polarised state practicing blatant discrimination of minority communal groups and economic classes isn’t news. Modi’s rise to power isn’t an anomaly; it isn’t just a chapter in India’s history – it's a carefully crafted manifestation of an ideology. \n\nHave you ever wondered how and why Jawaharlal Nehru’s “azaad” India has embarked on such a journey? How and why is the very nature of the world’s largest democracy being rebuilt? Is it really that bad?\n\nHindutva: who is a Hindu?\n\nWith the arrival of European missionaries in India, the practice of proselytism not only threatened the socio-religious structure of society, it also brought changes in its demography. To resist the new faith, Hindu reformers endowed their religion with egalitarian values through a reinterpretation of the – highly abstract in nature – Vedas. This led to the creation of a golden age of Hinduism which was then supported by movements such as the Arya Samaj. The 1919 mobilisation of Indian Muslims in support of the Caliphate of Constantinople – the Khilafat movement – solidified the “majoritarian inferiority complex” of the Hindus due to its Pan-Islamic nature.\n\nIt was in this context that VD Savarkar codified the Hindu nationalist ideology, citing four factors in determining the eligibility of a “Hindu” – race (Aryan decent and Vedic fathers), territory (Vedic land where the holy rivers flow), language (Sanskrit) and culture. Savarkar also pointed out the similarities between his definition of “who is a Hindu” and the Zionists. MS Golwalkar’s views on the topic went one step ahead. He believed that Muslims of India did not deserve “even citizen rights” in the Hindu state. Their only option was to either submit or leave. These were the narratives which led to the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1925.\n\nTowards BJP\n\nThe organisation which started off by combating communists grew into a tentacular Sangh Parivar over the years with numerous sector-based organisations that gradually saturated the social space. The aim of the Sangh Parivar is state formation, not mere state-building. RSS entered the political arena in the 1950s after Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination by an alleged member of the movement and a close aid of Savarkar. Undoubtedly a dark time in the RSS’s history, the national outrage led to the arrests of 20,000 Swayamsevaks and the outlawing of the organisation which Nehru saw as an “Indian embodiment of fascism”. The Bharatiya Janata Sangh (BJS) was created by Golwalkar in 1951 in response to these developments.\n\nIn the time leading up to Modi’s rule in Gujrat, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, formerly BJS) had garnered considerable support in India, capitalising on its role in the Ayodhya Movement which resulted in violent clashes between the Hindu and Muslim communities during the “Ram Yatra”. Since then, the BJP has emerged as a populist party in India’s ethnic democracy which is against any and all things it deems a threat to the RSS ideology. The BJP’s primary targets are Muslims and Indian secularism. Its more concealed motives include the continued socioeconomic repression of the other backward classes (OBCs) and the scheduled castes (SCs), together with a complete dismantling of the very ethos of India’s once renowned impartial institutions.\n\nA lesson in populism \n\nIf there was ever a book titled “populism for dummies”, an account of Modi’s rise to power is sure to make an appearance. A product of the RSS, Modi in a true populist fashion rose to power following the Gujrat riots. During this time, violence was promoted and validated against Muslims, the “other”, by Modi and RSS radicals in response to the Godhra tragedy. Communal differences were then exacerbated to a point of no return, and it is from here that Modi’s populism turned into national populism. His humble beginnings helped him connect with the masses on an unprecedented scale and his shrewdness coupled with charisma propelled him into the status of an “ideal”. He was at once borne out of a mythology yet remained rooted in reality.\n\nDistancing himself from the Muslims, Modi established himself as an “Emperor of The Hindu Hearts”. His economic policies accelerated the growth rate in Gujrat – albeit at the expense of the proletariat – which would later lead him to tout the “Gujrat Model” in his 2014 election campaign. Subsequently, in the 2000s, when Islamic terrorism was at its peak, Modi would find himself at the centre of assassination attempts supposedly sponsored by ‘jihadis’. It did not matter that there was a complete lack of evidence to support the claims that the Pakistani state was behind this supposed threat, or that the ‘jihadis’ arrested were later acquitted by the Indian courts. He had established his national populist repertoire – a feat which would get him elected as the prime minister for two consecutive terms.\n\nThe first term \n\nDuring his first term, Modi focused on raising the “self-esteem” and “dignity” of the Indian people by introducing programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jan-Dhan Yojana, and Ujjwala Yojana. While there were no concrete reforms to help raise the economic status of his newly created “neo-middle class” or the poor, he also scaled back on the previously launched pro-poor programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Modi’s urban consumer bias was apparent in the economic policies put forth which facilitated crony capitalism. He diverted the people’s attention by focusing on social justice and keeping communal violence brewing to appease his “angry young men” who had taken the law into their own hands primarily through vigilantism (The Bajrang Dal).\n\nThis constant cycle of fear of the “Other” converting into anger was apparent in the activities of the Gau Rakshak Dal. Moreover, campaigns against ‘love jihad’ and ‘land jihad’ further unveiled the anti-Muslim sentiments of not only the state but Indian society as well. In the larger scheme of things, Modi’s politics led to the banalisation of Hindutva, reformation of the education system in line with the RSS ideology, crackdown on secularists and free press, ‘reconversion’ campaigns, opening up the state apparatus to the RSS, and deterioration of India’s once revered institutions including the police, Supreme Court, media, and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\n\nModi 2.0\n\nBy the 2019 elections, India had already converted into a “De-Facto Hindu Rashtra”. Staying true to his saintly politics, Modi centered his campaign on an “external enemy” – Pakistan. The Balakot strikes following the Pulwama attack, together with Pakistan’s goodwill gesture of Wing Commander Abhinandan’s release were hailed as ‘victories’ in India. Interestingly, Bharat, by then, had embarked on a path towards electoral authoritarianism, thus the main opposition parties barely stood a chance.\n\nCapitalising off caste politics and plebian support for the “strong man”, the BJP, with the conquest of the Rajya Sabha, was now in a position to fulfill its primary objectives – the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the abrogation of Article 370. The Ayodhya verdict was the final nail in India’s secular identity. Christophe Jaffrelot thereby concludes that India is now an ethnic democracy wherein the Hindus are bound by racial, linguistic, religious or other such cultural characteristics. Their strong sense of identity is pivotal for the rejection of the “other” which isn’t protected by the government nor the international community.\n\nThe greatest divide \n\nIn a democratic structure, regardless of the adjectives, claiming to be ‘apolitical’ is perhaps the highest tier of ignorance. If democracy is a government by the people, for the people, and from the people, how can the two ever be separated? Of course, outliers do exist, but when a feat is present in majority, it becomes the norm. BJP’s anti-Muslim bias, RSS’s Hindutva ideology, and Modi’s populist politics exist and thrive in India, for the Indian people, by the Indian citizens, from the Indian society. India’s polarisation was triggered by deep-seated insecurities, and with multiple fears and numerous threats – real or fake – assimilation becomes the best course of action. While there is beauty in diversity, there is security in homogenisation. It looks like the people of India have chosen their rulers. Where this majoritarian rule leads Bharat will unravel a new chapter in the history of war itself – the Greatest Divide is yet to come.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1649243028-0/Cover1649243028-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "What should be on the OIC’s agenda?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97560/what-should-be-on-the-oics-agenda", "date_published": "Tue, 22 Mar 22 11:13:05 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) signed a charter in 1969 aiming for peace, solidarity and mutual economic development. One premium objective of the charter is the commitment of the states to following ‘International Law.’ The charter also profoundly adopts the fundamental freedoms, human rights and good governance for development as the core of the international policy system and organisational structure. Although criticised, another landmark development under the OIC system was the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, which complements the Declaration on Human Rights and other United Nations (UN) human rights instruments.\n\nFurthermore, the Astana Declaration as policy guidance for investment in science, technology, education and development is significant for the effective implementation of sustainable development goals or the development agenda of 2030. As the OIC is the second largest intergovernmental organisation after the UN, it was expected that it would be safeguarding Muslim rights and interests in the global policy system.\n\nHowever, the charter governing the 1.8 billion in the contemporary era of globalisation is still seeking an effective implementation plan because most of the developing and underdeveloped Muslim states are equipped with poor governance and mismanaged structures. The objectivity of the OIC in the developmental agenda counters the hegemony and individualistic approaches. As members of the OIC are currently meeting in Islamabad, it is worth considering what the OIC should aim to achieve over the coming years.\n\nThe member states of the OIC implemented non-interference in their internal matters and pursued secular interests over the developmental agenda. The war among a few Muslim States is one example. Foreign intervention is another. This simultaneously indicated in the past that Muslim states’ inter-relations in sub-systems cannot be translated into one big policy umbrella. The given issues also highlight the apparent reasons for not having any meaningful Muslim representation in the global policy system.\n\nThe pertinent question now is how the OIC, as the key representing the authority of Muslim states, can be effective in the global policy system. OIC theoretically attempted to portray itself as an organisation that upholds the ‘global Islamic agenda’, and that it is somehow similar to the UN instruments reflecting human rights, peace and sustainable development. To implement the human rights agenda effectively, the OIC must think about an organisational structure that may monitor and report to the authorities. There could be a multilateral court of justice following the regional judicial systems of Europe, Africa and South America.\n\nMore legitimisation of the OIC through establishing a meaningful ‘executive’ under the sub-state system shall present a robust approach towards implementing the local agenda of 2030. The OIC may also think about more sub-committees or sub-groups on diverse but common development policy programmes.\n\nAlthough it seems that the OIC has a limited role in the effective implementation of the agenda of Muslim states, the OIC may rethink how the local implementation of global agendas can help its voice in the global policy system. The OIC can bring together the states and people for common issues such as climate change, poverty eradication, human development and environmentalism.\n\nWhat is more prominent is that the initial establishment of the OIC emphasised the ‘Ummah,’ which may encompass the Muslim representation worldwide and welcome integration of other states with the Muslim population. More importantly, the affiliation in the OIC system as a non-observer state can be closely linked to present challenges of corruption, poor governance, unsustainable development, climate change and environmental crises.\n\nIt is undeniable that financial assistance is the only way forward for such agendas, and for such purposes, more extensive integration in the OIC of developed states cannot be avoided. So far, the challenges of inequitable growth and development are not addressed by the international policy systems and are unlikely to be resolved. The UN 2030 agenda has already suggested regional and sub-regional integration for common goals towards more considerable cooperation.\n\nIf the OIC is seeking an influential role in the sustainable development agenda of 2030, it should reframe its existing governance mechanism. The recognition of the future development agenda as suggested by the UN shall be recognised by the OIC and shall address the 17 primary goals for human development in the Muslim states. In doing so, the OIC must reconsider the assistance of policy experts, academia, social scientists, stakeholders and specific-area experts. Such initiatives will provide the OIC with valuable global representation.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1647948826-0/Cover1647948826-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "India’s institutionalised prejudice against Islamophobia", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97557/indias-institutionalised-prejudice-against-islamophobia", "date_published": "Fri, 18 Mar 22 10:35:30 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIndia recently called out the United Nations (UN) resolution which declares May 15th as the International Day to combat Islamophobia. TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, expressed concern that an emphasis on one religion takes away attention from the phobias against Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism. He states that India had offered sanctuary to Zoroastrians, Jews and others in the spirit of pluralism and expressed concern regarding the attack on gurudwaras (Sikh temples), the destruction of Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, and the glorification of the breaking of idols. Tirumurti further said he instead preferred the generic term religion-phobia to combat hatred against all religions.\n\nSuch a position was to be expected from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) India, which is bent on ‘decolonising’ the influence of past Muslim invaders by furthering the dharmic faiths (Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism) at the expense of demonising present-day Muslims and Islam. The fact that the ruling party remains strategically quiet when calls for genocide of Muslims are made is a testament to this observation. Scores of Hindutva trolls are usually out and about on Pakistani and other social media sites where they demonise Muslims and perpetuate their victimhood despite being an overwhelming majority in India. It is against this backdrop that the Indian representative brazenly projected his country’s institutionalised prejudice.\n\nHowever, Tirumurti conveniently failed to recognise and mention the systemic genocide of the Rohingya Muslims by Buddhists in Myanmar, the concentration camps of Uighurs in China, the mass destruction of Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq in a post 9/11 world that has led to the universal singling out of Muslims and Islam. He ignored the fact that two billion Muslims are often generalised and stereotyped as terrorists and that many Sikhs in the West are targeted not because of their Sikhism but because they are perceived as Muslims. In other words, the targeting of people of colour and Sikhs in the West is also because of Islamophobia.\n\nIt is true that Hindu girls face forced conversion in the Sindh province of Pakistan, but this oppression is unique to that province (based on feudalism) and is not found in Arab countries. Similarly, the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was perpetrated by the rogue Taliban and not other Afghans who have enjoyed good relations with India. In fact, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has recently facilitated the construction of a large Hindu temple as well. The same goes for Pakistan that unilaterally took steps to facilitate Sikh pilgrims to their holy sites in Pakistan. If anything, it was the Indian government that took draconian steps against Sikhs and the Golden Temple in the mid-80s.\n\nThe Indian representative mentioned the glorification of the breaking of idols, which is reminiscent of the past Muslim invaders from central Asia in the age of empires. However, those Muslim invaders from Persia, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and other central Asian places are long dead. It was a different time where human rights violations were perpetrated by anyone and everyone. The sacking of Baghdad by the Mongols is one such example. However, the BJP and its leader Narendra Modi seem fixated on the past and not on the present where their government has singled out and marginalised Muslims through the Citizenship Act.\n\nThe whatbaoutism of the Indian state in an attempt to deflect attention away from Islamophobia towards “religion-phobia” is clear for everyone to see. The words of Tirumurti remind us of those white supremacists who argue against “Black Lives Matter” by responding with “All Lives Matter”, or of those homophobes who argue against the Pride Parade by resorting to the inanities of “what about Straight Parade”.\n\nIt is time India stops comparing itself to Pakistan, which itself has huge issues of intolerance, and starts addressing its internal issues of the systemic discrimination and Hindutva calls for genocide of their own Muslim minorities.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1647603749-0/Cover1647603749-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistani migrants bounce back", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2370889/pakistani-migrants-bounce-back", "date_published": "Fri, 12 Aug 22 20:47:25 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe number of Pakistani nationals migrating for work mostly to the Gulf countries has bounced back to the pre-Covid-19 level to around 65,000 per month in January 2022 in the wake of rising income of oil exporting Arab countries and advanced economies around the world.\n\n“The monthly flow of Pakistani workers (abroad) has reverted to pre-Covid levels,” the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in its half-yearly report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for July-December of fiscal year 2021-22 released on Friday.\n\nOver 70% of Pakistani workers go to GCC countries mostly to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nThe number of migrating Pakistani workers plunged to zero during the initial five months of the pandemic – April-August 2020, according to the central bank’s report.\n\nThe normalisation of the flow of workers to foreign countries along with a surge in the income of oil exporting GCC countries indicates the inflow of workers’ remittances to Pakistan will remain steady at around “$32 billion in the current fiscal year 2023 compared to $31 billion in FY22”, Topline Research projected last week.\n\nAs many as 458,257 Pakistanis proceeded abroad for employment in the first seven months (January-July) of 2022. This translates into 65,465 in each of the seven months, according to the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment’s (BE&OE) official website.\n\nA record high number of 946,571 Pakistanis went abroad for employment in 2015, translating to 78,881 each month during the year, according to the Bureau.\n\nAccording to the SBP report, it took almost two years to normalise the monthly flow of Pakistani migrants for work to the Middle Easter countries to pre-pandemic level. It was January 2020 when around 65,000 Pakistani went abroad for job purposes last time before the outbreak of the virus in Pakistan in February 2020.\n\nThe central bank’s report said no word on the economic outlook for the current fiscal year 2023, as it usually does in its quarterly, half-yearly and annual reports. Instead, it gave an outdated outlook for the second half (January-June) of FY22.\n\nTo recall, the country achieved economic growth of 6% for the second consecutive fiscal year in 2021-22.\n\nThe central bank said in its latest State of Pakistan’s Economy report that the collection of revenue in taxes to the government increased notably, but mostly due to increased imports during the first half of the previous fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. \n\nFederal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) collection of revenue in taxes increased by 32% in the first half of FY22, notwithstanding somewhat slower growth in the second quarter (Oct-Dec FY22), as economic activities improved and general price levels rose as compared to last year.\n\n“However, most of this increase stemmed from import-related taxes, on account of the broad-based increase in import volumes, international commodity prices, and PKR (Pakistani rupee) depreciation,” SBP said in the report.\n\nThe government, however, sharply cut imports in the first month (July) of the current fiscal year 2022 to $4.9 billion to avert the risk of default on international payments ahead of the resumption of IMF’s extended $7 billion loan programme in last week of the current month of August 2022.\n\nThe imports had hit a five-month high at $2.3 billion in June.\n\nFinance Minister Miftah Ismail said the other day the curb on imports would remain in place over the next three to four-month to improve the country’s capacity to make import payments and foreign debt 946,571 repayments.\n\nThe import curtailment may compromise FBR collection of revenue in taxes in the three to fourth-month of low imports in FY23.\n\nFrom the perspective of the first half of FY22, the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) exhibited broad-based expansion, exports grew buoyant alongside growth in FBR taxes and Kharif crops recorded higher production, the central bank said.\n\nHowever, amid multi-year high global commodity prices, rising inflation and current account deficit posed a challenge as the year progressed, it said.\n\n“These pressures necessitated monetary tightening amidst other regulatory measures to moderate demand.”­­\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 13th, 2022.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/41660337318-0/41660337318-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Senate panel seeks details of PIA pilots", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2310861/senate-panel-seeks-details-of-pia-pilots", "date_published": "Fri, 16 Jul 21 06:16:48 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Senate Standing Committee on Aviation on Thursday sought details of the pilots working with the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and was briefed on the functions of the Aviation Division and its attached departments.\n\nThe committee meeting, chaired by Hidayatullah, reviewed working procedures, budget, number of employees, challenges faced by the Aviation Division and its subsidiaries and the performance of the institutions.\n\nAmong others, the meeting was attended by senators Syed Muhammad Sabir Shah, Faisal Saleem Rehman, Mian Raza Rabbani, Aun Abbas, Faisal Javed, Saleem Mandviwalla, Afnanullah Khan, Dilawar Khan and Sherry Rehman, besides Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Aviation Secretary Ali, Adviser to CEO PIA Amir Hayat, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Director General Flight Lieutenant (retd) Khaqan Murtaza, Airport Security Force chief security officer, Pakistan Meteorological Department director general and other senior officials.\n\nIt also looked into the measures taken by the Aviation Division to improve performance of the attached departments and its future plans to tackle challenges confronted on the professional front.\n\nIt was the committee's first meeting after its reconstitution followed by the Senate elections.\nHidayatullah said the committee proceedings would be made more effective with mutual consultation of the members so that the confronted issues could be removed in an efficient manner.

Kamran Ghulam\n\nKamran Ghulam may not be a household name yet since he hasn’t represented Pakistan national team till now, but people who follow domestic cricket closely know him as the next big thing.\n\nThe right-handed batsman, in the recently concluded Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, bettered the record for most runs in a single QeA Trophy season. The record, earlier held by Saadat Ali with 1217 runs, was broken by Ghulam in the final of the tournament where he was representing Khyber-Pakhtukhwa.\n\nHowever, this is not the only thing that pushed Wasim to include the 25-year-old in the squad.\n\nGhulam boasts a first-class average of over 53 with 31 matches to his name. He has scored nine 100s and 11 fifties to amass 2,413 runs, with a highest score of 166.\n\nIf he can build on his current domestic form when playing against South Africa, the visitors will find it hard to beat Pakistan in the two-Test series.\n\n2. Tabish Khan\n\nIf you’re a pacer outside Pakistan, you’ll probably start your career in mid or late-twenties and end it after your mid-thirties. However, right-arm medium pacer Tabish Khan will start his international career at 36.\n\nSome may say he was not international material, but with 598 wickets in 137 first-class matches, there is and there never was a valid reason to keep him out of the national fray. Well, he’s not the only one who had to wait a long time to get his chance, Fawad Alam is another case study in this regard too.\n\nThere is light at the end of every tunnel and Tabish had to travel miles to find his light and he would love to grab the chance with both hands when he bowls to the South Africans in Karachi and Rawalpindi in the two Tests.\n\nJury is out on whether he will be able to live up to the hype after spending his heydays in the domestic wilderness, but if Tabish wants to question a system which gives multiple chances to a few and nearly zero to some, he will have to utilise all the experience he has gained and get his first and maybe final hurrah on the international level.\n\n3. Saud Shakeel\n\nAnother youngster, with heaps of runs behind him and a first-class average of nearly 49, Saud Shakeel will don the greens of Pakistan during the two Tests against South Africa.\n\nAt the age 25, Shakeel has 3220 runs in his books in 46 first-class outings. He also has 10 tons and 17 fifties to boast about and if this is not enough, he can bowl left-arm slow.\n\nShakeel has come to the fore through the Pakistan cricket ranks and has played for the U19 team, which may prove to be a point in his favour as he had the grooming of a cricketer from an early age.\n\nAll in all, Pakistan have played a big gamble by benching their usual suspects and giving the domestic performers a chance to shine. This move may turn new chief selector Wasim into a hero that many were waiting for, however it can backfire too.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Kamran-Ghulam-PCB1611139704-0/Kamran-Ghulam-PCB1611139704-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "4 players who can help Pakistan beat New Zealand in third T20I", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2276840/4-players-who-can-help-pakistan-beat-new-zealand-in-third-t20i", "date_published": "Mon, 21 Dec 20 09:53:42 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan are against the ropes in the three-match T20I series against New Zealand as they’ve lost the opening two games and only a win in third shortest-format game can help them gain much-needed confidence when going into the Tests.\n\nPakistan stayed rigid in their approach and played the same elevens in the first two T20Is, but with the series already lost, it is high time Pakistan try something new on the field against New Zealand.\n\nWhile the option of chasing may present itself if Pakistan win the toss third time on the trot, a few changes in the eleven can also be beneficial for the stand-in captain Shadab Khan.\n\nHere are the three players who can walk in and help Pakistan win the third T20I against New Zealand.\n\n1. Sarfaraz Ahmed\n\nIf you ask a Pakistani cricket fan why Sarfaraz Ahmed was sent into the wilderness, even after taking Pakistan to the summit of the T20I rankings, they would not mention his batting, his wicketkeeping or his captaincy, but they’d rather blame it on him being a Karachi player.\n\nWhether this theory of the Pakistan Cricket Board being biased against Karachi players is true or not, one thing everyone can agree on is that Sarfaraz brings something to the field which many other players can’t – the much-needed energy.\n\nSarfaraz was famous for his animated and chatty wicketkeeping when he was captaining Pakistan in all formats and even though some may disagree, the energy he brought with his shenanigans was contagious.\n\nHim walking to the bowler before and after every delivery, his comments when someone dropped a catch or did a great job in the fielding, all of that is missed with Muhammad Rizwan behind the stumps.\n\nWith Shadab at the helm against a New Zealand side which he is finding very difficult to outwit, an experienced former captain behind the stumps can go a long way in helping Pakistan enforce a win when everything has failed to work.\n\n2 and 3. Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa\n\nWahab Riaz is not doing what he is supposed to do in New Zealand – be the experienced leader of the young bowling pack, and this gives way to Pakistan go for the young but express pace duo of Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa.\n\nInclusion of Musa can also help Shaheen Afridi take a much-needed rest before he is asked to run in and fire on all cylinders during the upcoming Tests.\n\nAlso, if Pakistan really want to make things interesting, they can always replace Haris Rauf with Iftikhar Ahmed. Iftikhar is considered to be a big-hitter, and also can bowl four overs of off-spin. Since New Zealand are perfectly fine when dealing with pacers, a spin of strategy may work in Pakistan’s favour.\n\n4. Usman Qadir\n\nWe all saw what the legendary spinner Abdul Qadir’s son Usman Qadir got from his father – a spin bowling masterclass.\n\nShadab has been off colour in the bowling department in the first two matches, maybe because of his increased focus on batting and recently captaincy and Usman can help fill the shoes of team’s first-choice leggie.\n\nIf there’s a question of who he should replace in the side, anyone between Khushdil Shah and Abdullah Shafique can give way to Usman, as many may still now know that he has the ability to bat quite nicely in the lower order.\n\nPakistan will be concluding their shortest-format series in the third T20I against New Zealand on Tuesday and they will need something new to surprise the hosts and make them submit. However, if they play safe and don’t make any changes, they will surely lose again, with dignity yes, but they will lose.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/comment1608542933-0/comment1608542933-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "3 reasons Pakistan lost first T20I against New Zealand", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2276467/3-reasons-pakistan-lost-first-t20i-against-new-zealand", "date_published": "Fri, 18 Dec 20 12:36:48 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThere was never a doubt that Pakistan would find it difficult to beat New Zealand at the latter’s home and the theory was proven true when the Kiwis beat Men in Green by five wickets in the first T20I of the three-match series on Friday.\n\nWith the defeat, Pakistan will have to pull up their socks for the next two T20Is if they want to salvage the series and win it.\n\nIt was also a sad day for Pakistan stand-in captain Shadab Khan who lost the very first T20I, where he stood as captain.\n\nA closer look of the first T20I shows there were a few things Pakistan could have changed or could have done to prevent the loss in the tour opener.\n\n1. No specialist openers\n\nPakistan won the toss and chose to bat first, but they missed the trick when they asked wicketkeeper-batsman Muhammad Rizwan and newcomer Abdullah Shafique to open the innings against New Zealand.\n\nUnfamiliar with the opening role, Rizwan lost his wicket due to a callous drive and a smart delivery by Jacob Duffy, while Shafique was found out in the second delivery he faced against the Kiwis. Shafique couldn’t fathom the bounce on the pitch and flighted one into the hands of mid-on fielder for an easy catch.\n\nWith the openers gone quickly, as has been the case for Pakistan since eternity, the middle-order, lacking the services of the great Babar Azam, fell like a deck of cards, thus the question of why did Pakistan go with two batsmen upfront who don’t understand the demands of the opener’s role.\n\n2. Batting failure (again)\n\nWith the openers gone, the onus fell on the middle-order to stabilise the innings, but a young Haider Ali was not up to the task. Here, once again, Pakistan did not think twice before sending him at the one-down position, where teams tend to send their best and most in-form batsman.\n\nHaider is all that and a little more, but he lacks the experience of playing at the third spot. However, the next best option to bat at number three, veteran Muhammad Hafeez, did equally bad in batting after being dismissed on the very first ball he faced.\n\nAll thanks to Shadab’s 42 off 32 and a late flurry by Faheem Ashraf, who scored 31 off 18, Pakistan were able to put up a fighting total, but if the top and upper middle-order would have added an extra 20 or 30, the match could’ve shifted in the visitors’ favour.\n\n3. The Wahab dilemma\n\nTo play him or not to play him has become one of the major questions Pakistan faces whenever they go out in the field. If Afridi’s is the pinnacle of mercurial batting, Wahab is all that in the bowling department.\n\nOne day, he would pluck the moon out of the sky for Pakistan and the next day he would turn a certain victory into a miraculous defeat. Is it just bad luck, or is it just his bad bowling at some points, no one can truly answer.\n\nThe latter happened on Friday, when Wahab gave away 45 runs in just 3.5 overs after being hit for two sixes and five fours. New Zealand batsmen were bamboozled in the middle of the innings by some top-notch bowling by Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Faheem Ashraf, but Wahab leaking away runs gave New Zealand the much-needed confidence.\n\nAnd if all that was not enough, Faheem dropped a catch off Wahab at fine leg and to add insult to injury, let the ball crawl away for a four.\n\nIt is quite evident now that people are prone to dropping catches off Wahab’s bowling at fine leg and square leg region. Everyone would remember the disastrous drop in the 2015 World Cup by Rahat Ali where Wahab had setup Shane Watson perfectly with world class short-pitched bowling.\n\nSo, do we curse the man or do we curse his luck, at least I can’t answer this dilemma.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/comment1608294842-0/comment1608294842-0-68779.jpg"}, {"headline": "3 reasons Pakistan will find it difficult to beat New Zealand", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2274087/3-reasons-pakistan-will-find-it-difficult-to-beat-new-zealand", "date_published": "Mon, 30 Nov 20 07:44:32 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan contingent is currently in quarantine in New Zealand as they prepare for face the hosts in three T20Is and two Tests, and there is only one thing that is certain in the current uncertain Covid-19 time – it won’t be easy to beat the Kiwis.\n\nHere are the three main reasons why Babar Azam can return winless, in the series and in all the T20Is and Tests, from New Zealand.\n\n1. Bad morale\n\nAfter news of Pakistani players testing positive surfaced, the team must have seen a fall in their morale as, according to reports, many first team players were affected with the virus.\n\nThis could have led to drop in motivation, while a warning to send the whole squad home after some players breached the Covid-19 protocol was also not inspiring.\n\nPakistan players may be pumped up to beat New Zealand in the latter’s own yard after such humiliation, but with players in gloomy isolation, losing hope and feeling down may be the most probable outcome of the saga.\n\n2. Lack of fitness and practice\n\nEveryone knows about Pakistani’s love for food and our cricketers are just humans. With nothing much to do in hotel rooms, food might be the only entertainment they’ve had through the first half of their quarantine. Hence, a lack of practice may cause lethargy when they hit the ground.\n\nAll this may result in lack of efforts in the field and as the adage of catches win matches goes, a few slipups are a possibility too.\n\nPakistani players will have to put some extra yards in before the matches, otherwise, if they do just enough, the performances will also be just enough and New Zealand will roll over the Men in Green with ease.\n\n3. New Zealand’s form\n\nNew Zealand may not have won many global cricketing tournaments, but they are not known for their big trophy cabinet, they are known for their consistency.\n\nIf they are not the best on a given day, you can surely expect them to be at their minimum best at least. Meanwhile, their opponents Pakistan are known to be the most mercurial cricketing side in the world – “one minute down, next minute up”.\n\nIt is this consistency in New Zealand’s performance that makes them a difficult side to beat and add home advantage to that and it becomes a perfect recipe for Pakistan’s destruction in the series.\n\nAlso, they are unbeaten in the T20Is in the series against West Indies. Their form can be seen in the fact that they have scored quickly in the first two matches, setting a 239-run target in first and chasing a 180-run target in just 16 overs in the second.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistani players last played cricket during the remaining matches of the PSL5.\n\nMomentum will be on New Zealand’s side when they host Pakistan, first for T20Is and then for Tests. Babar will have to come up with a magical formula to lift the spirit of the players who will be feeling under the weather, homesick, and also out of form and practice. If the skipper can do that then he may not only go on to become a batting legend, but also a captain whose name would be written in golden words.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Comment1606722149-0/Comment1606722149-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Is Trump right in saying ‘India is filthy’?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2270253/is-trump-right-in-saying-india-is-filthy", "date_published": "Wed, 28 Oct 20 13:11:05 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhile the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden produced fireworks, Trump’s remarks in the environmental context that “India is filthy”, became a matter of heated debate within Indian media. Indian social media went berserk and its reaction also became prominent on mainstream media. Some went on to ask Trump for an apology on these remarks, which most of Sanghi trolls thought had hurt millions of common Indians.\n\nWhile any nation would react to such remarks from any leader of global stature, Trump’s remarks had a profound effect as Mr Modi has done a lot of work to develop a personal relationship with Trump through the “Howdy,Modi!” rally in the United States and “Namaste Trump” programme duringTrump’s visit to India this year.\n\nWhile we respect Indian sentiments, it may be interesting to conduct an analysis of where does India stand in terms of cleanliness and environment.\n\nAccording to IndiaSpend’sState of Global Air 2020 report,116,000 infants died in India due to air pollution in 2019 — meaning one infant died every five minutes due to air pollution. The data further reveals that 1.67 million Indians died in 2019 due to air pollution causes.\n\nAs per a World Health Organisation report, approximately 120,000 children under the age of five years die due to diarrhoea every year. This indicates that waterborne diseases are rampant in India due to contaminated water and poor sanitation.Hookworms, which can spread through open defecation, cause diarrhoea, anaemia and weight loss in women, according to the report. These problems are linked to low birth weight and slow child growth — 38% of children in India under five are stunted, according to the National Family Health Survey data.\n\nThe Indian magazine, The Wire, reported in 2017, that India, the world’s second-largest country by population, had the highest number of people (732 million) without access to toilets. The report by WaterAid, titled “Out Of Order: The State of the World’s Toilets 2017”, further stated that 355 million women and girls lacked access to a toilet. If they were to stand in a line, the queue could circle the Earth more than four times.\n\nThe problem is that Modi’sSwachh Bharat or Clean India programme built millions of toilets at avery fast pace across Indian landscape; however, these have become dilapidated and unusable,adding to the problem. Adding to that is the factor of demographics: Indian population has grown from 1,330 million in 2017 to 1,380 million in 2019, that’s an additional load of 50 million. So even if India builds one million new toilets every year it cannot match the pace of population growth.\n\nA CNet report published on September 11, 2020, states that India spent $30 billion to fix its broken sanitation. It ended up with more problems. The Swachh Bharat mission, launched in 2014, was an ambitious effort to stop open defecation. It's far from reaching that goal.Lack of enough water to use in Swachh Bharat was bound to make it a failure. Imagine a community toilet built for 500 people in a cramped city with irregular or no supply of water. Within a week, it will not only become unusable but also become a source of disease spread. A survey of open source pictures and videos of Swachh Bharat toilets in overpopulated cities indicates that this grand programme has become a virtual dustbin.\n\nIn 2019, India was also home to 21 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities, studies say, based on air-quality data. Coal usage in power generation stands at a whopping 75% and coal is notoriously bad for environment. No wonder New Delhi maintains the record of being the most polluted capital of the world for the second consecutive year. Even drinking water of the Indian capital is contaminated, The Hindu, in 2019,sarcastically remarked, “If it wasn’t enough that Delhi air is among the world’s most polluted, a new study has now shown that the city’s tap water is the most unsafe among 21 states within India.”\n\nIndian rivers have become almost toxic due to overpopulation and flow of sewage and industrial waste into rivers which hug large cities.Oceanplasticcleanup.com conducted a study of the most filthy, polluted and toxic rivers in the world called the “Dirty Dozen”, and lo and behold, India gets another honour with the Ganges as the second most polluted river in the world and Yamuna as the fifth filthiest.\n\nThe Ganges has a perennial problem of religious rituals.Gangapollution.com keeps a watch on issues related to it. One of its report highlighted the pollution in Indian rivers: many parts of the Hindu faith revolve around the Ganges River, who they believe is the form of the goddess Mother Ganga on Earth. Because of this, many people’s bodies and ashes are placed in the river. Large amounts of ashes from crematoriums along the Ganges River in Varanasi are dumped in each year. Majority of Hindus are cremated and placed in the river after being burned by Dalits along the ghats leading into their goddess’ body. These ashes are keeping the river from being clean.\n\nDead bodies are also a huge pollutant to the already dirty water, with 35,000 bodies estimated to be discarded into the river,yearly. This is huge amount of dead people to be floating in an important source of water for millions of people. Many times, international observers have pointed out to the Indian government to take effective measures for respect of human remains as pictures of human bodies floating in the Ganges River surface almost every month.\n\nOther than air pollution, poor sanitation, filthy rivers and water contamination, India stands tall in noise population as well.A LiveMintreport on noise pollution in India describes an alarming picture.\n\nThe red light at a traffic junction is the universal sign for vehicles to stop — but in India, it is also a signal to start something else: relentless honking. When noise from constant honking is added to the general cacophony in cities, it becomes noise pollution — and this pollution can be costly and dangerous too.\n\nKnops.co conducts regular surveys of noise pollution across the globe. Its 2018 report puts India in the top noise polluted countries in the world. The Worldwide Hearing Index was created some time ago by digital hearing app founders, Mimi Hearing Technologies GmbH. They analysed the hearing test results of 200,000 of their users. They combined their results with data on noise pollution from WHO and SINTEF, a Norwegian-based research organisation, and used it to plot noise pollution in 50 different cities. The top five cities with the worst noise pollution include Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nTo conclude, President Trump may have casually mentioned ‘filthy India’, referring to environmental issues without much attention to research and scientific evidence, but he has been proven right. India tops the list of the most polluted countries in the world in sanitation, water, air, hygiene and even noise.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2182545-adeelanaureennew-1584984008.jpg"}, {"headline": "Why we need fear for effective disaster risk reduction", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2268212/why-we-need-fear-for-effective-disaster-risk-reduction", "date_published": "Tue, 13 Oct 20 13:18:35 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tToday is the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and living in a time of a global pandemic, the need to prioritise disaster risk reduction has become resounding and all too very real as almost every person and community is suffering from institutional and socio-economic lack of preparedness. \n\nPandemics are not new. Scientists and historians have been warning against a global novel virus for the past few decades. Beating their beakers and drums, trying to raise awareness among governments and businesses that this is not of a matter of if, but when. When the Ebola outbreak wreaked havoc in West Africa, the US State Department, under then president Barack Obama’s administration developed a comprehensive guide in dealing with and mitigating infectious diseases. This was of course completely thrown out by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nOn October 8, just a few days ago, Pakistan saw the clock tick to 15 years since the devastating earthquake of 2005. Pakistan bore colossal losses then. Nearly 20,000 children died while they were attending classes. In total, about 85,000 people died, another 140,000 injured and 3.5 million became homeless as 0.6 million houses were severely damaged.\n\nPakistan’s north was particularly devastated and Balakot, the epicentre, was destroyed in a matter of seconds and 15 years on is still struggling to re-build infrastructure and lives. There is hardly any significant rehabilitation or reconstruction. Rather, the funds that were allotted for Balakot’s rehabilitation have been redistributed to the Benazir Income Support Programme(BISP) and Covid-19 Emergency Fund. This speaks to how ill-prepared our DRR is, that funds for one disaster are siphoned for others.\n\nDRR is an incredibly lofty goal for a country that cannot rehabilitate its citizens from disasters that took place almost two decades ago. Pakistan is not the only country unable to learn from past mistakes and lack of preparedness. As stated above, the US, and rather most countries during the Covid-19 pandemic have proven the amnesia that collectively surrounds us when it comes to the destruction of disasters.\n\nDanish philosopherSørenKierkegaard makes a distinction between the concept of dread and fear calling attention to fear as having an object, a definable threat that we can identify. Whereas, dread is a response shrouded in unknowns, is speculative, not belonging to parameters or definitions. \n\nWe are unequivocally living in a global time of fear. We fear the coronavirus, we fear loss of jobs, lives, travel, routine, any semblance to the “old normal”. Our fear is driving conversations and changes around the “Great Reset”: how can this disaster be learned from in such a way that we build back the world, better?\n\nWhat can be changed about the status quo that protects citizens beyond economic and political interests? \n\nHow can this ‘new’normal truly be transformative and inclusive?\n\nFear’s object allows for these conversations to have actionable points and attainable goals. Fear makes having a game-plan easier. Fear divides people into groups of: ‘part of the solution’ or ‘part of the problem,’ as is evidenced by corona-shaming of non-mask wearers and political leaders who had to retract fake news and disinformation.\n\nDRR for objects of fear, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, is timely and due to its global nature, which unlike Ebola which was predominantly contained within the context of “poor” countries, Covid-19’s fear is ubiquitous and has spread to contexts that are not used to suffering —‘developing country’ailments. The politics of fear is also always at play. Who is fearful,who is bearing the brunt of the threat is always imperative. Thus, DRR for infectious diseases is at the forefront of the priority list and perhaps, rightly so.\n\nDread on the other hand, is objectless, casting anxiety far and wide without aim and thus, is much more insurmountable than fear. Many of us dread climate change in an abstract way. We hear the news of sea levels rising. We notice the irregularities of the seasons. We breathe in toxic air like it is a non-negotiable aspect of nature. We watch gut-wrenching clips of starving farmers and drowning residents. \n\nOften though these realities are not directly our own. The dread and threat of climate change is still far away, neatly tucked away somewhere in the future. This is why business-as-usual is the state of affairs when it comes to the economy, government, consumer behaviour and social order. \n\nDRR for dread does not have the same timely impact as DRR for fear.\n\nUnlike DRR for infectious diseases, DRR for climate change is failing to account for human, social and political disaster amnesia.\n\nWhen dread turns to fear, as one may have experienced during the recent floods that engulfed Karachi and other parts of the country, there is suddenly an actionable sensibility that grips citizens and governments alike. Especially when those citizens were elites and urbane. The problem solving caps come on as people are united against a common threat.\n\nHowever, as human populations have made unprecedented exponential advancements in the last three decades, the myriad of threats have also of course, multiplied. Existential threats such as Artificial Intelligence, climate change, cyber warfare, pandemics, to name a few, have caused mounting existential dread invariably leading to inertia of sorts.\n\nI guess the trillion dollar question is: how do we capture what we know about the difference between fearand dread to formulate and implement DRR that works with the psychology and sociology of communities and countries?\n\nThis year, the theme of the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction is governance which is defined as the measure by which“lives are saved, reduced numbers of disaster-affected people and reduced economic losses. Covid-19 and the climate emergency are telling us that we need a clear vision, plans and competent, empowered institutions acting on scientific evidence for the public good.”\n\nUnfortunately, we are all still enveloped in a fear-centric mode of thinking when it comes to DRR. For instance, Prime Minister Imran Khan has recently approved the construction of high-rise buildings in Islamabad. This is problematic for several reasons from a DRR and urban planning perspective.\n\nFirstly, contrary to popular opinion, high-rises are not green solutions. In fact, high-rises encourage vehicular clutter causing serious damage to both environment and humans alike, by increasing air pollution. Vertical urban sprawl wreaks havoc on air quality. \n\nSecondly, high-rise buildings are energy-intensive as glass is simply not very good at keeping excessive heat out, or desirable heat in. Even with technological advancement, the amount of power it takes to keep high-rises going poses a huge opportunity cost to greener solutions. \n\nLastly, Pakistan has many seismic zones and as many high-rises are vulnerable to earthquakes and not always structurally sound, the proliferation of high-rises in the country can pose mammoth near-future risks. Furthermore, high-rises, pose evacuation concerns. If you live or work in a high-rise apartment, you'll face a harder challenge trying to evacuate due to emergencies, such as natural disasters or fire.\n\nIt is said, “earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings do,” which begs the question why is our government taking urban planning measures that are increasing disaster risks rather than reducing them?\n\nOur Prime Minister has repeatedly said, “ghabrana nahi hai (don’t get scared)”; but, when it comes to disaster risk reduction, it would be very wise to be fearful.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Mavra-Bari1602595736-0/Mavra-Bari1602595736-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Public complaints", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2265484/public-complaints", "date_published": "Thu, 24 Sep 20 19:06:54 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn order to further facilitate the public and speed up redressal of their grievances, the government plans to link up all complaint management systems of federal ministries with the Pakistan Citizen Portal. Prime Minister Imran Khan recently issued instructions in this regard. All existing 33 complaint cells of federal ministries will be connected with the centralised complaint system. The PM’s Performance Delivery Unit (PMDU) will decide the modalities in consultation with relevant institutions and devise integration plans. The PMDU has been asked to complete the process within 60 days. The idea is to avoid delays resulting from a multiplicity of complaint cells and duplication of efforts thereby undertaking the process of complaint rectification on a fast track basis. This will also save time and resources. The purpose is to put in place a universal system with many-faceted connectivity features for a comprehensive global grievance redressal mechanism.\n\nThe centralised system will help citizens avoid confusion as now a number of complaint cells are functioning causing problems to both the people and government functionaries working for redressal of public grievances. The integrated system will help eliminate the delays involved in manual processing of complaints. It will bring the whole process of receipt, processing, and removal of complaints under one window, and help citizens get information about the status of their complaints and things related to them. The PCP started functioning as part of the PMDU from October 2018. During the past two years, as many as 28 million people have registered 115,000 complaints, on average, every month, with it. According to official figures, 2.2 million complaints have been resolved with 40% confirmed satisfaction. The rural population might not be getting the facility of the online PCP because of the unavailability of internet services in villages and small towns. This needs to be rectified.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, September 25th, 2020.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "Jodhpur killing", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2265483/jodhpur-killing", "date_published": "Thu, 24 Sep 20 19:06:21 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistani Hindus have begun protesting against the Jodhpur incident as well as the hardships faced by members of the minority community that migrated to India in search of a better life. The false dreams that many of them have are regularly shattered by the harsh reality of India’s still-strong caste system, which rarely allows lower-caste Hindus to rise. Many of the Pakistani Hindu migrants are from those lower castes. For this, they often end up having to wait for decades to be allowed to become citizens of a country that claims to welcome all Hindus.\n\nPakistan Hindu Council Patron-In-Chief Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani made a much more explosive claim that Indian intelligence agencies have been forcing Pakistani Hindu migrants and tourists to speak against Pakistan and even killing people who refuse to do so. As evidence, Vankwani referred to the last month’s case of 11 members of a family who died under mysterious circumstances in the Indian city of Jodhpur in Rajasthan. The family had moved there years ago, motivated by those same false promises of a better life in India. Instead, they ended up being poisoned in their home.\n\nThe case itself is interesting for the secretive manner in which India has acted. The family of subsistence farmers was clearly not spies, yet India has refused to share any investigation details with Pakistan or allowed access to the survivors, even though they all were still Pakistani citizens at the time they died.\n\nVankwani implied that this was because a surviving family member had nominated the RSS and the ruling BJP in the police report. He also noted that no arrests had been made in the case which is extremely concerning.\n\nAfter decades of throwing accusations about the treatment of Hindus in neighbouring Muslim countries, India has shown that it is just as dangerous.

However, while many of the more prominent voices making those calls may appear to have a direct stake in the game — such as the PTI’s political rivals — the truth is that rumours have surrounded the finances of most other major political parties as well. Contrast that with political activists and others who have been calling for reforms for decades, yet have been largely ignored by the powers that be. \n\nClean elections and good governance should not be partisan issues. Unfortunately, failure to update election and political financing laws, or even enforce existing ones, is a collective failure of the political parties and the bureaucracy because it deprives citizens of their basic rights, while also ensuring that truly independent candidates from middle-class or poor backgrounds just can’t compete with the big guns. But maybe that is the point — securing the positions of the ruling elite while also ensuring that they stay in line. \n\nOver the weekend, open government and election transparency advocates at the Free and Fair Election Network , or Fafen, also brought up how political parties inside and outside the parliament need to strengthen regulations to limit the ability of big spenders to virtually buy elections, warning that free-spending without consequences deprives citizens of the right to contest elections and skews results towards big spenders, regardless of whether they are backed by billionaires or smaller, individual donors. \n\nThe weaknesses in the system begin with the current iteration of the law governing elections — the Elections Act of 2017. The act is astoundingly weak in its grants of regulatory power, and can be directly blamed — along with its authors — for allowing the 2018 general election to turn into the biggest spending polling cycles in the country’s history, even when inflation is taken into account. Bye-elections and local bodies polls conducted since then have also seen unprecedented spending, effectively consolidating power among the ultra-rich, whether directly as candidates or through the political parties they bankroll. Strongly enforced spending caps can be problematic in bigger constituencies and areas with higher advertising costs, but they are still probably the easiest place to start. \n\nDonor transparency is another area which needs to be investigated. This could be done through a public database which parties and candidates must regularly update with every political donation received and details of how funds are spent. The same would also apply to private groups and individuals financing political campaigns. Criminal penalties, as long as they are fairly applied, would be more than enough to change the face of Pakistani electioneering, certainly making it cleaner and, hopefully, a little more representative.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 11th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "PDM fiddles while the economy burns", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369873/pdm-fiddles-while-the-economy-burns", "date_published": "Sat, 06 Aug 22 18:44:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe only thing seesawing faster than the Pakistani rupee right now is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s political capital. So, here’s a contrarian take on what’s happening to the Pakistani economy. The real crisis is one of confidence, and not just economic fundamentals. Consider this: Pakistan faced a similar economic crisis at the beginning of PTI’s term and then again at the beginning of Covid-19. In both cases, stability and economic growth were restored. In fact, unlike most countries where public debt rose significantly during Covid-19, we were able to reduce our public debt-to-GDP ratio by about five percentage points through Covid-19. So, why does this economic crisis feel like the end of the world?\n\nThe underlying crisis of confidence this time is rooted in politics versus economics. Let’s unpack the previous economic crisis Pakistan overcame to contextualise this one better. To simplify, PTI’s core challenge in 2018 was inheriting an unsustainable current account deficit with the country standing on the brink of dollar default, while PML-N’s core challenge was to reverse fuel subsidies. The first two years of PTI’s government were hard for our economy because PML-N gave an ailing economy to Asad Umar. \n\nThe primary challenge was a current account deficit of $20 billion thanks to Dar’s fixation on keeping the rupee artificially overvalued versus the dollar. An artificially high rupee meant it was cheaper to import things than to produce them in Pakistan or export goods. Hence, our industry hollowed out, exports declined during PML-N’s tenure and imports we couldn’t afford thrived, bringing us to the verge of bankruptcy when PTI took over. \n\nPTI took politically unpopular but wise decisions to correct these sins, including the painful devaluation of the currency. The idea was they would rescue the economy first, then stabilise and then put it on the growth path. Halfway through stabilisation, Covid-19 hit. Despite Covid-19 though, Pakistan clocked in growth at over 5% over the last two years. This was so good that PML-N argued last year that the numbers had been fudged by the PTI government, only to validate growth numbers this year after over-throwing the PTI government. PML-N even used these healthy growth numbers to secure the latest IMF deal. \n\nHowever, when the PML-N was strategising to overthrow PTI through a vote of no confidence, their primary argument was that PTI was mismanaging the economy and a competent team was needed to restore order. Four months later, we are experiencing the fruits of labour from team competence, with the rupee nosediving and inflation skyrocketing. \n\nIn a provocative recent column, former State Bank Governor, Raza Baqir asks why this crisis feels more dramatic when the economic fundamentals are actually better than before: ‘Given that we successfully restored stability and growth in the recent two challenging crises, why is there not a shared sense of calm confidence that we should be able to do the same this time round? This question is particularly relevant because our reserves and public debt are better today than they were in the 2019 balance-of-payments crisis before the start of the IMF programme. At end-June 2019, our gross reserves had dipped to around $7bn; at end-June 2022 they were around $10bn.’\n\nHe goes on to argue about the central role politics is playing in this crisis. And the next logical question to ask is what is the core driver of the political instability in the country today? The answer to that question is simple, the vote of no confidence against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The irony is that while PDM brought a no-confidence motion against Imran Khan, it’s the Pakistani economy that’s expressing no confidence in the PDM government today. If there’s one lesson everyone can learn from this train wreck, it’s that civilian Prime Ministers should be allowed to complete their five-year terms for both political and economic stability.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 7th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131.JPG"}, {"headline": "Afghan humanitarian crisis", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369656/afghan-humanitarian-crisis", "date_published": "Fri, 05 Aug 22 18:34:35 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfghanistan has a long history of destruction and suffering, be it man-inflicted or natural. Since the Russian invasion in December 1979, Afghanistan has become a battleground of world superpowers and is surrounded by an unending wave of destruction.\n\nAfter the foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan, Pakistan hosted an exclusive Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference to discuss the Afghanistan issue. The conference focused on the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and exploring new avenues to address the rapidly worsening humanitarian situation in terms of food shortage and potential economic collapse. Foreign ministers of member countries, special invitees from the United Nations (UN), international financial institutions, and non-member states, including the US, UK, European Union, and Russia attended the session. Afghanistan’s delegation was headed by the acting foreign minister.\n\nPakistan’s initiative to host the 17th session of the emergency meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the OIC demonstrated Pakistan’s strong will to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan. All member countries unanimously agreed that peace and stability in the region can only be achieved by forming a broad-based and inclusive government that is representative of the entire Afghan society. \n\nDecades of conflict and instability in Afghanistan have left millions of people on the brink of starvation. Some 24 million Afghans were already in need of humanitarian assistance because of the economic crisis and lack of development aid. The situation was further exacerbated after the recent earthquake in Paktia and Khost, which left nearly 1,500 dead and many more injured. \n\nFollowing the earthquake, the Afghan government appealed for international support to address the crisis. The Pakistani government responded immediately by dispatching consignments of relief goods. On 22nd June, the first convoy of 8 trucks carrying tents, tarpaulin, and blankets from the National Disaster Management Authority reached Afghanistan. On 24th June, another consignment of relief assistance was sent through aircraft. Besides this, Pak-Afghan Cooperation Forum (PACF) also sent 5 trucks carrying 37.5 tons of food, winter bedding, tents, tarpaulins, and clothes. \n\nEarlier, PACF had also organised free eye camps in the hospitals in Kabul and Khost where thousands of Afghan patients were provided free treatment by Pakistani doctors. The forum also facilitated the first batch of Afghan children with congenital diseases who will receive free medical treatment in Pakistan. \n\nTo promote bilateral trade with Afghanistan, the Pakistani government decided to relax the visa policy to ensure long-term and sustainable trade between the two countries. Under the new policy, six months of multiple entry visas will be issued to transporters from Afghanistan. Pakistan has also decided to import coal from Afghanistan, which can help Pakistan generate cheaper electricity and save nearly $2.3 billion. \n\nSince August 2021, the economic crisis and collapse of the banking sector have made it extremely challenging to get money into Afghanistan. International humanitarian organisations and the UN have scaled up assistance to address rising needs, but aid cannot replace the services of the state. To institutionalise financial support, a trust fund was established at the OIC conference. However, the international community remains reluctant to allow cash inflow.\n\nDuring this difficult time, the international community must lift sanctions and release Afghan funds as the country has descended into a serious economic crisis. The international community must realise that this is not the time to settle scores or debate on issues of legitimacy or recognition. They must resume aid and support the Afghan people to mitigate their miseries. \n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 6th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Javed-Iqbal1659724580-1/Javed-Iqbal1659724580-1.jpg"}, {"headline": "Dialogue urged to end political uncertainty", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369231/dialogue-urged-to-end-political-uncertainty", "date_published": "Wed, 03 Aug 22 07:47:41 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tChief of Qaumi Watan Party (QWP), Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao on Tuesday while showing concern over current political state of affairs, suggested a grand dialogue for all political par-\nties to ease the situation.\n\nTalking to media persons, Aftab Sherpao said if a grand dialogue among political entities was not held, it would be harmful for the country and its economy.\n\nSuggesting two resolutions to end wrangling between the political parties, Sherpao said in politics the doors of negotiations and dialogue were never kept closed.\n\nHe said if Hasina Wajid and Khaleda Zia could sit on one table in Bangladesh for the sake of their country, then why the government and opposition in Pakistan cannot have reconciliation dialogue.\n\nHe said the political mercury which has touched the new heights of confrontation needed to be brought down through talks.\n\nThe confronting politics, he said, have also badly hit the country’s economy that was a matter of great concern and must be understood by the politicians.

Recently, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the Padma Bridge and declared it a ‘symbol of pride and capacity’. As early as 1992, Sheikh Hasina was involved in the economic issues and plans for Bangladesh. She undertook the task of balancing economic policies with political implications. Sheikh Hasina shifted focus from her father’s socialist agenda toward market-based capitalist growth. She learnt from other Asian countries whose economic success was based upon four pillars: political stability, social development, trade liberalisation with export-led growth and fiscal restraint.\n\nDuring a conference, when an economist began informing her about the benefits of trade liberalisation, Sheikh Hasina quipped, “you don’t have to convince me about trade liberalisation. When I was living with my physicist husband in the Italian city of Trieste on the Yugoslavian border, I watched the border being opened three times a week and people travelling across from both sides, purchasing goods and return.” This demonstrates that Sheikh Hasina was assiduously focused on economics rather than other considerations that politicians are attracted to. \n\nEven though between 1971 to 2009, Bangladesh had hiccups in accountability campaigns and military rule, since 2009, the army has taken the back seat. Bangladesh has seen less frequent derailment of civilian governments and experienced little legitimisation and delegitimization of governments. Although its democratic history is not untainted, Bangladesh’s government has largely avoided public criticism about corruption and inefficiency. Despite having little experience in governance, the Prime Minister possessed visionary acuity and conviction that economic progress was the only way to alleviate poverty in the country. \n\nAlthough marred by allegations of coercion of opponents, after over fifteen years of sustained growth, Bangladesh has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Back in 1970, the country was 75% poorer compared to Pakistan but now it is 45% richer. In 1970, it had 10 million more mouths to feed but now its population is 170 million compared to Pakistan’s 230 million. In 2021, Bangladesh’s exports were $47 billion while Pakistan’s exports were $28 billion. The income per capita in Bangladesh is $2,227 compared to Pakistan’s $1,543. In 2022, its gross domestic product (GDP) is $411 billion compared to the $347 billion in Pakistan. The annual inflation rate is 6% compared to Pakistan’s previous 12-15%, which has now risen to 21% and is expected to further increase. Also, the Bangladeshi taka is much stronger compared to the Pakistani rupee. Importantly, Bangladesh has a strong literacy rate with high female participation in the economy.\n\nIn Pakistan, political parties have remained interested in personal gains. The repeated manipulation of the democratic process has stymied the growth of strong, democratic, and non-dynastic parties. It is worth recognising that economic growth is closely tied with political stability, rule of law, strong civilian institutions, and participatory democracy. Pakistan inherited an overdeveloped state with a feeble bourgeoise linked in a patron-client relationship with a powerful state. The country has inevitably witnessed an economic and political evolution marked by privilege and patronage. Agriculture and business incomes are primarily excluded from the tax net. There is an absence of progressive wealth tax and huge industrial and estate complexes are exempt from any levies. Our parliament is dominated by landlords, it is a small wonder that agriculture income tax has been relegated as an inconsequential subject to the provincial domain. Consequently, the tax net remains small as agriculture and industrial sectors are undertaxed.\n\nSince 1958, all experiments with the government have augmented feudal power instead of empowering the masses. The growth path pursued in Pakistan has been skewed in favour of the privileged, rich, and elite who must now make their fair contribution to the state. \n\nFollowing Bangladesh’s example, Pakistani leadership must pursue economic growth as the national agenda and adopt constitutionalism along with regional peace. Without compromising viable defence, adequate resources must be released for social and economic development. Considering that regional avenues of growth necessitate trade liberalisation, foreign trade agreements must be formed with India, Iran, China, Afghanistan, and other trading partners. Also, the export-led growth model should refocus on high-value-added goods.\n\nPakistan enjoys a comparative advantage in cheaper labour, which must be transformed to improve skills and productivity. Education and technical training for women must be promoted and adopted widely to increase women’s participation in the workforce. Also, a safe and legally conducive environment is crucial for foreign investments. \n\nA serious effort is required to levy a fair tax on agricultural incomes and the rich industrial cartels must make their due contribution to national wealth. Besides wealth and death taxes, large corporate and estate sectors need to be brought into the tax net.\n\nPakistan’s leadership can learn many lessons from Bangladesh’s experience, but the main takeaway should be that Sheikh Hasina prioritised economic growth, which is crucial for both defence and democracy.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 2nd, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Sahibzada-Riaz-Noor1655837455-1/Sahibzada-Riaz-Noor1655837455-1.jpg"}, {"headline": "A stitch in time", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368349/a-stitch-in-time", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Jul 22 19:56:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhen Imran Khan first came to power, he repeatedly lamented the insufficient political space to pursue his promised agenda. PTI was new to governance and struggled to find direction. This found comparisons with other governance models mostly bordering on unchecked power and singular control. The closest we come to it in a democracy is the presidential form but it sits against the ethos of a parliamentary governance model — more popularly accepted given our peculiar political environment. Legislation and parliamentary support for substantial reform stood unattended and PTI’s agenda remained undelivered. That was the moment to return to the electorate for a new mandate through a snap, mid-term or early election. He dithered and stalled till the chips fell. And then it was too late.\n\nToday the nation and the state is at a cross-road and most paths lead out to further disaster than seen in the last six months. It may be politics to those engaged in it but it spells life and death for a nation. There hasn’t been a more precarious moment in our national history. Politics, so used to arbitration, isn’t finding one at the moment — so controversial have the traditional points of mediation turned. The army and its leadership was maligned at will for the most part of the last six years. Any insinuation of the army’s leadership amounts to deliberate subversion, sedition and disruption in the military order. It is now a daily fodder. That the military politicised itself so much as to be a fair game is something for it to ponder over and deal with; but in a country where institutions have had to lend a hand in governance, their need to arbitrate when politicians feud will never go away. With such malicious and vicious attacks on it, the military has been literally neutralised.\n\nMaking courts controversial is the next ploy. The focus is on subverting the judiciary in public non-cooperation to contrive decisions of a side’s liking. A political system’s inability to resolve its own predicaments means that courts are asked to arbitrate. They are then framed for activism and judicial coups in public narrative when decisions don’t go their way. This is patent blackmail. In an environment where the economy is on the verge of crashing, if not already crashed, the threat of a default looms, 120 million people of Punjab have been without a functioning government for the last four months at the hands of political shenanigan-ism, the military is fighting a rear-guard action against terrorism in its midst, and the international environment is tenuous, fragile and laden against us politically and economically, governance is a non-functioning entity while politics is at best fratricidal and predatory. Those responsible for each of these, fiddle instead in crass opportunistic entanglement. There isn’t an institution left that has not been tarnished. So complete is the insinuation and slander. The crisis meanwhile only deepens and engorges us from all sides.\n\nThere are four possible ways-out from the current predicament:\n\n1) There can be a reset of the entire thing as has been the traditional resort when the army intervened and installed a transitional government after it had stalled into inaction. It has always left serious negative consequences to politics and governance in the country and skewed the balance of power unfairly. In the army itself the effects are substantively adverse and distasteful to its own professional culture. It is best avoided.\n\n2) The courts may declare a state of mis-governance in the country and an absence of a government that strictly conforms to the legal, constitutional and moral mandate to claim power. It may then emplace a national government composed of both political and non-political technocrats to fill-in for a period of 6 months to a year to reform and reset what has become broken in the normal course of things resulting in political stagnation. Historically, political classes have manipulated constitutional and legal statutes in their favour. Politics has also tended to corrupt the judicial system through inducement or fear of retribution or manipulation through parliamentary power to proverbially cut the wings of what is perceived a largely independent judiciary — a sine qua non in a democratic state. This option may seem appealing given our state of disorder and institutional break-down, though political parties for the most part will play spoilers to this arrangement by disassociating and disowning the reform process. Arbitrating structures must find a way to engage with political structures to make them a willing part of the process. A constitutional protection will be needed to safeguard any statutory recourse for making governance more sustainable and consistent.\n\n3) The third option is the Sri Lankan way. When the control of the government and its capacity to govern melted away, the only remaining power was that of the people on the streets. Law enforcement agencies could only do so much in the initial stages of the uprising but as soon as it got bigger and voluminous, law enforcement drew back to avoid bloodshed against its own citizens. The option engenders anarchy and chaos, and fragments a nation’s and a society’s core ethos as well as its physical and structural pillars. A nation may then dissolve and a state may cease to exist. In a nuclear-capable nation, it remains unthinkable and will invite intervention, even external. Although Imran Khan has waved this bogey often in a hope to elicit institutional support in favour of his political objectives, it remains a red-flag event needing constant monitoring. Khan has been very poorly and insidiously advised to use this option as a ploy. We have enough political and moral acumen in the country to save us from such a disastrous consequence.\n\n4) Our polity, so used to external arbitration, perhaps needs it the most in current times. It stands dysfunctional and polarised to the point of rupture. Seemingly there exists little possibility for political players to come together in consensus on critical issues. Such is the intensity and depth of the divide. Yet it remains the only saviour out of our debilitating predicament. The President, the army, and the judiciary will need to come together at this precarious moment beyond their respective constitutional domains to avoid a multi-sectoral meltdown of the state and the nation. The agreed mechanism in the 1973 constitution continues to be either subverted or manipulated for political favour, forcing resort to the judiciary for adjudication. Necessary tweaking of laws and statutes may be needed in a consensus to enable sustainable, resilient, transparent and effective governance both at the center and in the provinces. Early elections and a new mandate are essential for a credible government to carry an effective voice with multilateral and bilateral partners.\n\nA half derelict non-concern for a free-falling economy by the government seems more a ploy to keep the powers-that-be interested in rushing the props to keep the government in place. Such purposed neglect is insidious and needs immediate redressal. We cannot sit idly by as negative politics unravels the order. A stitch in time will save us some more.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 29th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Shahzad-Chaudhry1592677757-0/Shahzad-Chaudhry1592677757-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan pulls out of India chess event", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368293/pakistan-pulls-out-of-india-chess-event", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Jul 22 06:50:07 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan have withdrawn from the world's biggest international chess tournament in protest at hosts India holding a torch relay for the event through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Thursday.\n\nThe 44th Chess Olympiad will see over 1,700 players from 188 nations compete in Chennai from now until August 10.\n\nThe last two competitions were played virtually because of the pandemic.\n\nThe Kashmir dispute has weathered decades of violence and upheaval since it was partitioned between India and Pakistan when both countries became independent in 1947.\n\nThe neighbours both claim it in full and have fought two of their three wars over control of the territory.\n\n\"By passing the torch relay through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir...

And yet, the military-industrial complex continues to thrive, elite capture remains elusive, and the juggernaut of divisive politics continues to cause fissures in our cultural zeitgeist. A colossal amount of black money — Pakistan’s illegitimate parallel economy — remains unseen, unreported and untaxed. Whether we are a police officer or a judge, a petty officer or a general, a building contractor or a factory owner, we continue to lie, cheat and defraud others and our country on our way to achieving our goals. Our economy and our morality both are on the cusp of default. As a society, we cannot stoop lower.\n\nIf there is one trait that defines political leadership like none other, it is narcissism. In our frenzied political landscape, knocking at the door of the Supreme Court has become an obsessive-compulsive ritual. If our politicians don’t get what they want, they are quick to approach the highest bench. Regardless of which party they belong to, if the judges rule in their favour, they are hailed as honest and impartial; if the judgements go against them, the same judges are deemed as partial and biased.\n\nOn July 22, a letter was waved once again, this time in the chamber of the Punjab Assembly. This time, it was the Hamza-Elahi face-off. We were back to watching television news shows where uncouth tirades were interrupted by even more uncouth tirades hurled by so-called political pundits. But here is the gist of the problem: legal discussions on the constitutionality of a matter are enlightening, they’re a thing of beauty; but when polluted by partisanship, these same discussions lose their intellectual value.\n\nWhy are politicians so obsessed with hanging on to power? The answer lies in the question itself: power. And this brings me to the power paradox which simply means that we act with empathy and modesty at first but quickly turn to coercion, manipulation and exploitation as soon as we acquire power. Whether we are corporate executives or CEOs, monarchs or political leaders, or even patriarchs in a patriarchal society, the power paradox applies to all of us. Inherent within us is a proclivity for pathological addiction to power, vanity and self-importance.\n\nIs greed a precursor to the power paradox? Is greed the driving force for success? Gordon Grekko, a character played by Michael Douglas in the movie Wall Street, puts it bluntly when he says, “the point is ladies and gentlemen that greed is, for lack of a better word, good.” The fact remains that we are rats in a rat race. Greed feeds our egos. Greed also divides us between the haves and the have-nots, between the exploiters and the exploited. Karl Marx was prophetic about our fate under capitalism: “Money is the universal, self-constituted value of all things. It has therefore robbed the whole world, human as well as natural, of its own values.”\n\nOut of hope or despair, we follow political leaders only to be ushered to the innermost circle of hell. On the one hand, we have political clans that remind us of the Sicilian mafia, the Cosa Nostra. On the other hand, we have a self-aggrandising braggart who shares a passing resemblance with Mussolini. We gather in thousands and listen to them deliver inspiring speeches just like Hitler did about a hundred years ago or Donald Trump more recently. They promise to save our country, to restore our lost glory, our greatness and excellence, while they make secret deals behind closed doors in the dead of the night.\n\nIn Botan Doro, a chilling ghost story, a handsome Japanese samurai falls in love with a beautiful girl carrying a lantern who visits his town every night but disappears before dawn. Smitten with her charm, he chases her down. They begin to spend the nights together. One early morning, the samurai’s nosy neighbour sneaks into his house and finds him dead in his room with his body locked in a tight embrace with a skeleton. The woman was nothing more than a ghost, a seductress.\n\nI wonder if we are all chasing a ghost.\n\n \n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 28th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Dr-Baqar-Hasnain1649437948-0/Dr-Baqar-Hasnain1649437948-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Sanity should prevail", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2367958/sanity-should-prevail", "date_published": "Tue, 26 Jul 22 19:41:28 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe conducts of our political leaders, betraying lack of sense of responsibility and going at any length to stay in power, provide a living example of why nations fail. Not that Pakistan has a history of clean politics but the present crisis especially in Punjab is extremely serious and is taking place when global and regional conditions are pitched against us.\n\nMore consequential is the fact that the country’s economy is in dire straits and the government is desperately seeking IMF and friendly countries to bail it out. Instead of focusing on the best use of scarce resources to satisfy the needs of the people, mismanagement is making matters worse. History seems to be repeating itself as both PTI and the PML-N-led coalition are seeking the support of the army leadership and putting pressure on the judiciary to tilt verdicts in their favour. Whatever tactics the government may employ to stay in power in Punjab and at the Center will only add to the misery of the silent majority, and strengthen the army’s leverage.\n\nImran Khan’s deliberate policy of ignoring democratic institutions and shunning the opposition defies the basic concept of pluralism and tends toward dictatorial instincts. When the entire political energy is geared towards demolishing the opponent instead of presenting oneself as a better candidate or party through performance, the political scenario can turn ugly very quickly. And this situation we are already witnessing. Besides, the prevalent policy of all political parties of blocking programs and initiatives that the previous government had initiated irrespective of country needs has to cease. By such inimical responses the worst affected are the ordinary people. It is unfortunate that the ruling party and the opposition are weakening the political structure and pursuing policies that undermine the economy and lower the image of the country. Moreover, such elite and party polarisation has filtered down at the grass-root level.\n\nIn all the main political parties — PML-N, PTI and PPP — there is excessive concentration of power in the top leadership that is preventing the advantage of making and implementing better policies that would have emerged otherwise from valuable input from the higher tier leadership where sufficient talent and experience resides. Unless political parties do not internally democratise, there is scant hope of improving the quality of democracy at the national, provincial and local levels. Moreover, when political parties have a mix of conservative and liberal, educated and experienced in sufficient numbers, politics of compromise and a certain level of decorum prevails. That seems a long way off and our present challenge is how to reduce the animosity and bitter rivalry among political parties. The flow of dirty money to influence political behaviour has become common place and politicians, instead of enacting laws and taking disciplinary action against the violators, are frequently promoting it. Checks and balances are already in our system but these are largely ignored. We have to work towards the goal to revive these, but to expect that our politicians in their present state of mind would be thinking along these lines would be day-dreaming. Can we also afford to give up and let the country continue to slide?\n\nAdding to our national woes is the adverse international environment. The Russia-US confrontation over Ukraine requires deft handling of foreign relations and the economy in which a better understanding and cooperation of major political parties is necessary. Due to accelerating global inflation and scarcity of basic essentials, especially of fuel, agricultural and industrial products, not only are the prices rapidly increasing but they are frequently becoming scarce. Unfortunately, there is hardly any realisation of these developments that is reflected in the political behaviour.\n\nThe US-China rivalry has also stepped up as President Biden has taken an aggressive posture toward China to dampen its fast-growing economy and influence in the coming years. Apart from its overall negative global fallout, it creates not only economic but also strategic restraints on Pakistan. It would remain a challenge for Pakistan diplomacy to steer this hostile terrain. While remaining steadfast in maintaining a strategic relationship with China, Pakistan should seek close relations with the US in terms of economy and trade. But, here too there is no serious thought being given apart from leaving it to our diplomats. Fortunately, we have highly professional and dedicated diplomats, and presently a competent Foreign Minister that is managing foreign policy astutely under trying conditions. What cannot be overlooked is that Pakistan’s foreign policy would carry weight when Pakistan is internally stable and its economy is strong.\n\nWhat is worrisome is that in this anarchic domestic situation, education, infrastructure, healthcare, and research and development are being ignored with serious consequences for the country’s future. The IT revolution and expansion of globalisation has been only partially absorbed. Leaders struggling for political survival are thinking and planning largely on a short horizon and neglecting these areas. This also has to do with the quality of the power structure and priorities that are driven by special or personal interests. Similarly, how many politicians are listening to the lone voice and warnings of Sherry Rehman on climate change and global warming. Or that of Raza Rabbani, Aitzaz Ahsan on wise political and constitutional issues. Successive government leaderships have been unwilling to open their minds to issues that are long-term, despite the reality that climate change is occurring right here largely due to human activities. There is an urgent need to give serious thought on how to respond to it and should invite interest across the political spectrum.\n\nBut despite the highly disturbing political and economic situation we are experiencing, it can all change provided some sanity among top political leadership prevails. Imran Khan has to lower his rhetoric, take serious issues to parliament and refrain from shaking the frail political structure. And the PDM coalition leadership should avoid political vendetta, take effective measures toward improving governance and lifting the economy while the clock is still ticking.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 27th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1083504-TalatMasoodNew-1460481455/1083504-TalatMasoodNew-1460481455.JPG"}, {"headline": "PM Shehbaz's son in the soup for 'incitement to violence' on Twitter", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2365432/pm-shehbazs-son-in-the-soup-for-incitement-to-violence-on-twitter", "date_published": "Sat, 09 Jul 22 11:12:07 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfter a Twitter account purportedly belonging to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's oldest son --- Suleman Sharif, urged his followers to \"toss shoes\" and \"name and shame\" a family that heckled Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal in a viral video on Friday, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf supporters heavily trolled the businessman's post and called for the account to be blocked for trying to incite violence.\n\n\n\nمیرے شیرو جہاں اس فیملی کو دیکھو۔ جوتے مارو۔ اس گنڈا گرد اور گنڈا لیڈر @ImranKhanPTI اور چورنی پیرنی نظر آئے 🦯 تیار رکھو۔ https://t.co/2srX5PMXJ9\n— Zi Suleman Sharif (@zi_suleman) July 8, 2022\n\n\nIqbal was targeted by PTI supporters as he stood in a queue waiting to place his order in a fast food joint at Bhera Interchange near Punjab's Sargodha.

In this regard, health officials in Rawalpindi were baffled to detect large number of dengue mosquito larvae at 16,000 different locations — 15,601 houses and 1,000 other localities — during indoor and outdoor surveillance campaigns. This is indeed an alarming revelation which could lead to a deadly outbreak in the near future.\n\nIt is believed that these dengue larvae have been breeding on a large scale during the ongoing monsoon season that saw many places inundated with water. Where there is stagnant water, dengue mosquitoes are bound to increase in number and become a health threat. The district has been carrying out anti-dengue campaigns but unfortunately implementation has been lacking as 99 locations were left out and fake activities were recorded in 377 locations. Officials have taken timely action by registering FIRs, sealing buildings, issuing challans and enforcing dengue SOPs but a systematic action plan must be carried out to destroy breeding grounds before these larvae mature. The ordeal also indicates the importance of draining rainwater in a timely manner. But with many provinces across Pakistan witnessing unprecedented levels of rain, dengue could very well escalate into a national health crisis. This merits attention from the very top.\n\nSurveillance campaigns must be carried out across flood affected areas to identify and destroy breeding grounds. Urban cities must issue dengue SOPs and work towards draining the remaining water left in affected localities. Abandoned buildings along with ponds, pools and other bodies of water in recreational spaces must not be left unchecked. But most importantly, the healthcare sector must be notified and well-equipped to deal with any outbreak.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 19th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "tabiyat.pk joins forces with Hayat Kimya to add quality mother and baby products to its portfolio", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2371800/tabiyatpk-joins-forces-with-hayat-kimya-to-add-quality-mother-and-baby-products-to-its-portfolio", "date_published": "Thu, 18 Aug 22 07:22:34 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\t \n\nIt has been announced that MEDZnMORE's tabiyat.pk has signed an agreement with Hayat Kimya, the fifth largest diaper manufacturer in Pakistan.

Doctors have advised citizens to take precautions to avoid catching the disease during the current weather conditions.\n\nAccording to Ophthalmologist Dr Tahir Farooq, conjunctivitis is an eye infection that spreads rapidly from one person to another. “Generally, this infection gains momentum in the summer or rainy season. During moist weather conditions, conjunctivitis spreads very rapidly but it can be prevented by taking preventive measures,” he said.\n\nHe said that people must frequently wash hands and avoid hand-to-eye contact to keep eye infections at bay. \n\nThe doctor said that people should avoid rubbing their eyes with fingers as they contain germs and can lead to an infection. He said that people should not share towels, napkins etc as doing so can raise the risk of suffering from eye infections.\n\nNaveed Shams, a patient suffering from conjunctivitis, said that seven out of 11 persons in his house have fallen prey to conjunctivitis.\n\nPatients suffering from the disease feel severe irritation in their eyes and it becomes very difficult to open their eyes in the sunlight. “The patient's eyes become red and water starts discharging from the eyes. I have been visiting the doctor for the last three days, but I did not get any sort of relief,” he said adding that he was following the precautionary measures said by the doctor so that other members of his household would not catch the disease.\n\nAccording to the data obtained from three allied hospitals in Rawalpindi, the number of patients with conjunctivitis has increased in the rainy season as compared to normal days\n\nAs per statistics released by the three allied hospitals, 12 more patients suffering from conjunctivitis have landed in hospitals in the last 24 hours.\n\nEye disease expert Dr Mudassar said that conjunctivitis can also be caused by dust rising after the rain. He said that polluted air and excessive use of fast lighting devices were also the cause of this disease. \n\nHe said that citizens have to show responsibility to prevent the spread of conjunctivitis.

In a globalised world, the internet is no longer a luxury.\n\n“The internet is one of the greatest inventions of all time,” said blogger and influencer Nouman Younus. It has changed our lives in so many ways and is making life easier for us. “We can communicate with people from anywhere in the world, share our thoughts, get inspired by other people's ideas, learn new things and much more.”\n\n“Internet is an important service that sustains our digital age,” said Soban Khan, a first-year student of BS computer sciences. “Internet has been a source of information and communication globally. This connectivity enables people to communicate with each other across the globe.”\n\nThe internet was a large network of computers, according to Khan. It was also a network of networks, which were connected together in a web-like configuration. “The internet is made up of many other networks, each with its own purpose and function — some for hosting websites, others for government agencies and businesses, he said.\n\nAnd then there are those who use it simply to connect with other people around the world.\n\nThe internet had been used for numerous purposes, said Nouman Younus. “Students can use the internet to access information and resources, as well as communicate with other classmates, he added.\n\n“It is also used for social purposes. People use the internet to connect with others and share ideas that may not be shared offline, such as through social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter.”\n\nPeople used the internet to watch videos about the subjects they were interested in, listen to music that matches their taste, play games or read books online, said Soban Khan.\n\n“The internet has become an indispensable part of our life. It is used for entertainment, communication, education and work. It is also used for banking, shopping and healthcare as well as research.”\n\nRead more: Heavy rains, floods cause internet outages in Pakistan\n\nAccording to Nouman Younus, the internet revolutionised the way business was being done these days. “It has made it easier for people to start a business from home. If you have an idea, you do not need to wait until you get out of college or after graduating from college because there are many sites that can help you get started with your own business,\" he said, pointing out that this was the reason why we are seeing the young generation beginning to earn much earlier compared to previous generations.\n\n“It has made it easier for people to find information about a product or service,” he said.\n\n“This means that instead of having only one source of information, like magazines or newspapers – which sometimes don't cover everything – consumers now have access through various sources such as blogs and social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook,” he added.\n\n“This allows them not just to learn more about something but also give feedback on their thoughts about what should happen next and the companies could improve their products on the basis of the feedback.”\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/internet1597032111-0/internet1597032111-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "US lawmakers unveil bill to help news media negotiate with Google, Facebook", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372714/us-lawmakers-unveil-bill-to-help-news-media-negotiate-with-google-facebook", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 08:59:39 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tA bipartisan group of US lawmakers on Monday released a revised version of a bill aimed at making it easier for news organizations to negotiate collectively with platforms like Google and Facebook.\n\nThe Journalism Competition and Preservation Act \"removes legal obstacles to news organization's ability to negotiate collectively and secure fair terms from gatekeeper platforms that regularly access news content without paying for its value,\" according to a news release from the lawmakers.\n\nThe group includes Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican Senator John Kennedy, both members of the Judiciary Committee, and House Judiciary Committee members David Cicilline, a Democrat, and Ken Buck, a Republican.\n\nA previous version of the bill, introduced in March 2021, was opposed by two technology industry trade groups that Meta Platforms' Facebook and Alphabet's  Google belong to - the Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice.\n\nThe updated bill would cover news publishers with fewer than 1,500 full-time employees and non-network news broadcasters.

Cyber-terrorists and state-sponsored hackers are the key actors in cyber-war, who not only attack websites to deface them and steal Facebook accounts, but also compromise and destroy our country's economic security.\n\nA malware agent used in a cyberattack for military, paramilitary, or intelligence purposes is usually referred to as a cyberweapon. Data theft and electronic or physical destruction are examples of cyber weapons. While a cyberweapon nearly always causes direct or indirect financial harm to the target organization, direct financial gain for the sponsor is not the primary goal of this type of agent.\n\nA cyber-army is a group of troops with advanced cyber talents who are extremely competent in information technology. Countries should use cyber-armies to maintain national cybersecurity. China is ranked first in cyber defensive power, followed by the Netherlands and France, then the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the United States leads in cyber offensive, cyber norms influence, and cyber intelligence. Teams at Cyber Command are allocated to specific adversaries — including Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China — and have worked with the intelligence community for years to get access to digital networks. Cyberweapons are stealth weapons that, like any computer code, are written in zeros and ones. They have the ability to infiltrate entire networks as well as infect individual PCs. They have the ability to block communication systems, confound enemy signals, and stop military attacks before they happen, all without the flash and bang of traditional weapons of war.\n\nAlthough cyber warfare is a new phenomenon in its current form, the notion is as old as warfare itself. Rivals used to try to physically interrupt their opponent's communication networks in the old days as well. Similarly, using all available means, well-thought-out strategies were used to gain access to information systems and develop mechanisms of misinformation in enemy ranks.\n\nHumans are becoming increasingly reliant on technology due to rapid advancements in communication tool applications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the efficacy of these technical techniques was put to the test. Even the most advanced states with cutting-edge medical facilities were crippled for months, forcing everyone from executives to administrative staff to work digitally from their homes.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of cyber threats has muddled the internal and external dimensions of national security, allowing less powerful state and non-state actors to increase their influence efforts. One of the causes that have fostered the formation of hybrid threats or made irregular warfare more appealing is the shifting nature of traditional ideas of armed conflict and war, because these may not motivate military action.\n\nDue to its great capacity to disrupt communication infrastructure, cyberwarfare is now regarded as a more appropriate tactic for offensive action against a rival. This is particularly risky because it has the potential to immobilize the target system for the duration of the disruption. Highly sensitive defense installations, such as command and control systems, missile-firing sites, air defense systems, and, more importantly, strategic decision-making mechanisms, may be included in these systems.\n\nThe race for space dominance, which began in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik-I by the then-Soviet Union and ended in 1958 with the launch of the United States' first manned space voyage, was perhaps to attain improved connectedness, integration, and networking in the decades to come. However, knowledge gained via advancements in the fields of information and space technology is now being used in a bad way to disrupt the same communication and integration.\n\nState institutions have become increasingly vulnerable as a result of the use of cyber warfare as part of a strategy to disrupt enemy lines of communication and cause harm to their prospective capabilities. Personal security, which is an important component of human security, is also vulnerable to disruptions in communication, location, and financial activities, to name a few examples. As a result, international and national organizations must establish legal procedures to ensure that cyber warfare does not violate an individual's rights or deprive him or her of his or her financial assets. \n\nCyber-warfare tools used by the military could eventually fall into the hands of hackers. According to Interpol Secretary General Jurgen Stock, in a few years, state-developed cyberweapons will be available on the darknet, a hidden area of the internet that cannot be accessed using search engines like Google.\n\n\"In the physical world, that is a significant problem—we have weapons that are used on the battlefield today and will be utilized by organized crime groups tomorrow. The same is true for digital weapons that are currently in use by the military, have been created by the military, and will be available to criminals tomorrow.\"\n\nRansomware, in which hackers lock down a company's computer systems and demand a ransom payment to regain control, is one of the most common cyberweapons. Cyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nCyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Moscow has been blamed for a number of cyberattacks that occurred before and during its military invasion of Ukraine, but it has always denied the allegations. Meanwhile, Ukraine has solicited the assistance of volunteer hackers from all around the world to aid in its defense against Russian aggression. A \"significant number\" of cyberattacks go unnoticed. \"It's not just law enforcement that demands we develop bridges between our silos, the islands of information,\" says the author. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Cybersecurity Outlook study, the number of cyberattacks worldwide more than doubled in 2021. According to the research, ransomware remains the most common sort of assault, with firms being targeted 270 times each year on average. Critical energy infrastructure and supply lines are being jeopardized by cyberattacks. \n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/top-view-unrecognizable-hacker-performing-cyberatt1659791000-0/top-view-unrecognizable-hacker-performing-cyberatt1659791000-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Future Fest founder Arzish Azam represents Pakistan at BSV Global Blockchain Convention in Dubai", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2359364/future-fest-founder-arzish-azam-represents-pakistan-at-bsv-global-blockchain-convention-in-dubai", "date_published": "Tue, 31 May 22 15:40:56 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfter the success of Future Fest 2022 on May 13-15 in Islamaba, Arzish Azam was invited to represent Pakistan as a speaker at BSV Global Blockchain Convention at Grand Hyatt Dubai held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Saud bin Saqr al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council – Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah.\n\nFuture Fest is the largest tech conference of expo of Pakistan, attended by big web3 companies such as Binance, Epic Games, Kucoin, BitOasis and BSV.

Since the enabling expression of “may be released on bail” is used in this part, read with the basic principles of criminal justice, the grant of bail in a non-bailable offence that does not fall within the second part of Section 497(1) CrPC is said to be a rule and refusal an exception.\n\n\"The second part of Section 497(1) CrPC provides that an accused shall not be released on bail if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for ten years. This part of Section 497(1) CrPC which prohibits the grant of bail in certain offences is popularly known as the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\"\n\nHowever, the order said that the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC provides that the court may direct that any person under the age of sixteen years or any woman or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be released on bail.\n\nThe expression “such an offence” used in this proviso refers to the offence mentioned in the second part (prohibitory clause) of Section 497(1) CrPC, as for all other non-bailable offences the court is already empowered to release the accused on bail under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nThe first proviso has thus made equal the power of the court to grant bail in the offences of prohibitory clause alleged against an accused under the age of sixteen years, a woman accused and a sick or infirm accused, to its power under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\n\"This means that in cases of women, etc., as mentioned in the first proviso to Section 497(1), irrespective of the category of the offence, bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as an exception in the same manner as it is granted or refused in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nExceptions\n\nThe apex court also noted that the exceptions for refusing bail in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC are therefore also applicable to the accused who pray for bail under the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC in an offence falling within the prohibitory clause.\n\n“These exceptions are well settled by several judgements of this court. They are the likelihood of the accused: (a) to abscond to escape trial; (b) to tamper with the prosecution evidence or influence the prosecution witnesses to obstruct the course of justice; or (c) to repeat the offence keeping in view his previous criminal record, nature of the offence or the desperate manner in which he has prima facie acted in the commission of the offence.\"\n\nRegarding the case in hand, the bench noted that they do not find any material that would attract any of the above exceptions in order to refuse bail to the present petitioner.\n\n\"We are cognizant of the fact that the persons involved in the commission of offences of robbery or dacoity are usually professional criminals and there is a likelihood that they would repeat the offence if enlarged on bail.

Likewise, when the FIR is registered then the court should also initiate a contempt proceedings or not.\n\nThe Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday decided to initiate contempt proceedings against Imran Khan for passing controversial remarks regarding female sessions court judge Zeba Chaudhry.\n\nAt a rally in Islamabad’s F-9 park on Saturday, Imran had threatened to file cases against Islamabad’s inspector general (IG) of police and deputy inspector general (DIG) of police and declared: “We won’t spare you.” He then warned the judiciary against its “biased” attitude towards his party, saying that it should brace itself for the consequences.\n\nThis is not the first time the court is taking up a contempt matter against Imran. However, the PTI chief has managed to secure relief in such cases.\n\nIn 2013, the top court had summoned cricketer-turned-politician Imran for a contempt hearing over his \"critical and derogatory\" remarks against the judiciary.\n\nImran, who had by then made a major breakthrough in the general election, had allegedly said that the polls were rigged and criticised the judiciary and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not taking notice.\n\n\"While holding press conference on 26.7.2013, he (Khan) stated that the role of judiciary and Election Commission of Pakistan is shameful in the conduct of general elections; that the elections were rigged, due to role played by these two institutions,\" the apex court’s notice read.\n\nHowever, in a major relief for Imran, the Supreme Court decided to drop contempt proceedings on the suggestion of the then attorney general for Pakistan Muneer A Malik.\n\nA three-member bench headed by Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali discharged the notice after hearing the arguments of AGP Munir in the case who said that it is not the matter of disobedience.\n\nThe judgment said that admittedly, Imran Khan is a public figure and duly elected member of the National Assembly who has not only been actively involved in politics for a considerable period, but also heads a political party.\n\n\"In such circumstances, while considering his conduct, we also cannot lose sight of the provision of Articles-19 and 66 of our Constitution, relating to freedom of speech and the privileges of members of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament).”\n\n\"Thus, at this juncture, as a note of caution, we may observe that politicians and other public figures having their say and a following amongst the public are expected to use more decent and guarded language and have to be more careful in the selection of words in public gatherings or press conferences so as to show their intellect, maturity of mind and wisdom qua respect to various national institutions, and to present themselves as role models for the society at large,” the judgement noted.\n\nSimilarly, earlier this year, the Supreme Court refused to initiate contempt proceedings against the PTI chief over the non-implementation of its May 25 order.\n\nThe apex court had issued clear instructions to hold its Azadi March protest near Peshawar Mor between the H-9 and G-9 areas of Islamabad. However, Imran and his protestors did make their way toward D-Chowk, prompting the government to call in the Pakistan Army for the security of the capital's Red Zone.\n\nThe apex court had formed a five-member larger bench, headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, to hear the application filed by Attorney General of Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf.\n\nHowever, SC Judge Justice Yahya Afridi, while dissenting with the majority order, observed that a contempt proceeding should be initiated against PTI chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan for instructing party activists and supporters to proceed toward D-Chowk in violation of the SC's May 25 order.\n\nHe noted that there was sufficient material before the SC to initiate a contempt proceeding against Imran Khan over violation of the May 25 order and instructed the party activists and supporters to proceed toward D-Chowk.\n\nHowever, instead of issuing a contempt notice, the majority judges on June 1 sought reports from director generals of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) as well as Islamabad IG police, interior secretary and others over the alleged involvement of PTI leaders in instigating party workers to reach Islamabad's D-Chowk in violation of its May 25 order.\n\nLater the court was apprised by the law enforcement agencies that a “crowd was organised to enter Red Zone under the PTI leadership who had reached Express Chowk with the intent to proceed further towards D-Chowk as per the directions of the party’s highest command”.\n\nThe matter is still pending in the apex court.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/court-hammer1658069967-0/court-hammer1658069967-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Administrative issues jack up NHA project costs", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372681/administrative-issues-jack-up-nha-project-costs", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:15:58 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe cost of 33 National Highway Authority (NHA) projects has increased from Rs79.5 billion in 2008 to Rs90.73 billion in 2021 due to non-availability of funds and delay in land acquisition.\n\nAccording to the documents available with The Express Tribune, between 2008 and 2021, 33 projects of the authority were completed at cost overruns.

My enthusiasm was further bolstered by the welcome board en route to Makkah which stated “Guests of Ar-Rahman, your safety is our responsibility”.\n\n\n\nOn July 7th, I joined the one million pilgrims – 1.5 million less than in 2019 – in Minna. This was the largest Hajj gathering since the pandemic had forced numbers to 10,000 Muslims in 2020 and 60,000 Muslims in 2021. Suffice to say, all eyes were on the Kingdom. This year’s Hajj also coincided with 100 years of Saudi Arabia’s organising of the annual pilgrimage. Hajj 1443 was made all the more special since it coincided with a Friday, making it Hajj-e-Akbar.\n\n\n\nCompared to my previous experience, the zeal among the pilgrims seemed somewhat diminished. At first, I believed these to be misapprehensions given the reduced numbers. However, increased interaction with my companions made me realise that the pandemic, circumventing all biases, had been hard on everyone regardless of stature. Without a doubt, Covid-19 has broken each and every one of us in some way. The white barrier between the Kabbah and pilgrims was a reinforcing testament to the ‘new normal’ we have all been forced to adopt.\n\n\n\nFrom my past encounters, I was on the lookout for miracles. And I was not disappointed. A friend had related that the people of Makkah claim that clouds provide shade to the Hujjaj. I witnessed this first hand on the Day of Arafat – considered the apex of Hajj – during which unexpected clouds started forming in a previously clear sky, thereby making it tolerable to sit outside in the 44-degree heat. The same happened during the rest of the pilgrimage days. Each ritual reaffirmed what I had grown up hearing: “Hajj sabr ka naam hai” (Hajj is the name of patience), which further reinforces the South African phrase “Umuntu Ngumuntu Ngabantu” (I am because of what we all are). This feeling, I believe now, is a miracle in itself.\n\n\n\nIn line with their Vision 2030, this year, the Kingdom had undertaken many experiments and introduced many changes, with mixed results. A major issue was for those journeying from America, Europe and Australia who had to apply for Hajj using an online portal. There was a lack of clarity in the draw process and mix ups, as a result of which, many people were turned back from the airport.\n\nHowever, this is not to take away from the many improvements I witnessed. In keeping with their national rejuvenation plans, the Saudis had increased the application of modern technology by harnessing the best electronic devices available. This included the “In your languages, we welcome you” campaign, which aims at guiding the pilgrims in 23 languages. This highlighted increased inclusivity and accommodation of pilgrims which I had previously not witnessed.\n\n\n\nA robot introduced in the Grand Mosque, Makkah to distribute Qurans to worshipers.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable sights for me was to see Hajjis zooming along on electric scooters. As a trial service, the Saudi Public Authority for Transport provided pilgrims with this service to help ease the time taken between Holy sites. For instance, the usually one-hour walk between Arafat to Muzdalifah was reduced to just 15 minutes. This is in addition to the Saudi Hajj Ministry’s adoption of smart technologies to help assure comfort of the Hajjis.\n\n\n\nBy the same token, there were visibly increased numbers of security officials and scouts to aid the pilgrims not only during the rituals but also in and around the Holy Mosques. Another marked change was the greater role of the youth in all areas of pilgrim assistance; be it spraying water on the pilgrims to provide relief from the heat or medics and security personnel.\n\nSimilarly, even though on previous visits I had noticed the expanding role of women in workplaces in the country, this time around it was very distinct. Now there were uniformed women officers inside the Mosque, women volunteers at the airport and even women administering passenger data input. These tasks had previously been reserved for men alone.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, after a two year international hiatus, Hajj 1443 was a success and a triumph for the Muslim ummah in the face of the trials and tribulations brought on by the pandemic. Restored, refreshed and recentered, I departed Madina airport, leaving a part of my soul in Makkah and a piece of my heart in the Prophet’s (PBUH) city.\n\n\nAll photos courtesy of the author.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1081507-HajjTawafKaabaAFP-1460156940/1081507-HajjTawafKaabaAFP-1460156940.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan and Iran: The potential for a great alliance", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97602/pakistan-and-iran-the-potential-for-a-great-alliance", "date_published": "Wed, 22 Jun 22 08:36:24 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMarred by sectarian violence, opposing interests, differing foreign policies and failed economic possibilities, Pakistan-Iran relations have soured throughout the years. As a result, Islamabad has seldom explored the possibility of deeper relations with its western neighbour.\n\nAlthough Pakistan and Iran co-operate on a multitude of different platforms and sectors, the degree of cooperation has often been tested, and a considerable amount of blame for this falls on Pakistan’s shoulders. Shackled by its external constraints, primarily in the form of American influence, the risk of Saudi alienation, and the sanctions on Iran, Pakistan has consistently remained reluctant to pursue deeper relations. Iran, on the other hand, has shown a willingness to strengthen bilateral ties, the chief example being the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline. Islamabad’s lack of interest has not gone unnoticed in Tehran.\n\nIndignant about Pakistan’s ambivalent foreign policy, Iran has sought a closer relationship with India, which has proven to be a resourceful and trustworthy partner. In direct competition with Pakistan’s Gwadar port, Indian support helped Iran mobilise Chabahar as a major oceanic port in the region. Furthermore, Indian influence in Iran has helped India to indirectly meet its nefarious interests against Pakistan, particularly vis-a-vis Balochistan and Southern Afghanistan. As a result, Islamabad’s lack of interest in seeking a meaningful relationship with Iran has weakened its overall influence and created a region where Pakistan is becoming increasingly cornered.\n\nHowever, the obstacles which once sought to hinder Pak-Iran relations are now beginning to wither away, paving the way for a potentially great alliance.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Pakistan faces when it comes to Iran is pressure from its ally, the United States (US). America has been explicitly vocal against any form of cooperation between Iran and Pakistan, and it is no secret that it has sabotaged numerous initiatives between the two nations. However, following the war in Ukraine, America has had a change of heart. With the threat of a severe energy crisis inexorably hitting the developed and developing world, America has confronted the situation by re-engaging with countries that it once had vowed to eschew.\n\nIn March 2022, after years of estrangement, a senior American delegation had a rare face-to-face meeting with the Nicolas Maduro government in Caracas, Venezuela, the world’s most oil-rich country. The meeting had a one-point agenda: replace Russian oil with Venezuelan oil. Similar energy-focused engagements with Libya have also been undertaken by the US. More interestingly, the Biden administration has felt the JCPOA agreement (Iran Nuclear Deal) should be revived to relieve Iran of its sanctions and benefit from its abundant gas and oil supplies. Talks in Vienna are already underway and major headway is being made, highlighting the possibility that a deal could once again be struck.\n\nAmerica’s change in position is driven purely out of necessity for its own self-interest; however, with no end in sight in Ukraine, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US is adopting softer attitudes toward its oil-rich adversaries, in particular Iran. For Pakistan, this is a now or never opportunity: capitalise on the west’s relaxation now and secure deals with Iran or delay the opportunity and ultimately face the wrath of the west.\n\nAnother hurdle Pakistan faces when it comes to Iran is the Saudi Arabian question. Any venture with Iran risks the upsetting of ‘brotherly’ Saudi Arabia, and although Pakistan has remained explicitly neutral in the pair’s cold war – through the training, support, and cooperation with its armed forces – it is clear that Islamabad indirectly sides with Riyadh. As a result, Pakistan’s alliance with the Saudis bars it from exploring real terms with Iran.\n\nIn the past year, however, there have been growing signs of rapprochement between the two arch rivals. Through the meditation of Iraq and Oman, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been willing to sit at the peace table and are now engaging in their fifth round of direct talks. Furthermore, with the cessation of hostilities in Yemen as well as the re-opening of the Iranian representative office in the OIC, analysts are hopeful that the two countries are finally coming to some form of an agreement, and the possibility of re-establishing diplomatic missions is not too far fetched.\n\nAs for Pakistani gains in light of such developments, they are significant. Not only can Islamabad now engage peacefully with Tehran, without alienating Saudi Arabia, but it can also facilitate further reconciliation between the two countries and emerge as a key mediator of peace in the region.\n\nWith the roadblocks to cooperation finally lifting, Pakistan and Iran can pave the way for a great alliance. This alliance can take two forms, one of an economic dimension and the other of a non-economic one. However, the beauty of a Pak-Iran alliance is not in its business prospective nor the cultural linkages but in the fact that it is mutually beneficial. At home, both Iran and Pakistan face pressing issues of different kinds, yet both sides can help each other solve their respective problems.\n\nThe major cornerstone of Pak-Iran relations has been the proposed Pakistan-Iran (IP) gas pipeline, a proposition which can mutually benefit both sides simultaneously. Stretching from South Pars all the way to Punjab, the 1900km pipeline would provide inestimable value for both Pakistan and Iran. As it currently stands, however, the IP gas pipeline is an opportunity fading away. Despite the project’s inception nearly a decade ago, the pipeline has yet to even start. Iran’s side of the pipeline is built but has simply been left to rust, while Pakistan’s side is waiting to start construction.\n\nThe causes of Pakistan’s lack of initiative is due to the abovementioned external pressure coupled with internal distrust, leading to the project’s early abandonment. However, this can all change. As stated before, Iran’s rapidly changing geopolitical image, as well as the easing of Pakistani challenges vis-a-vis foreign policy could usher in a new wave of enthusiasm. The IP gas pipeline could finally restart and ultimately benefit the two countries immensely.\n\nPlagued with severe energy shortages, depleting indigenous sources and inchoate industries, Pakistan is on the brink of energy starvation. So far, loans and expensive imports have kept the energy sector afloat, but these are short-term solutions and are unsustainable in the long run. As for local energy sources within the country, they too have proven insufficient.\n\nUltimately, Pakistan will need to increase its imported energy, preferably at cheap and subsidised rates. Once revived, however, the IP gas pipeline can solve the majority of these problems. Providing 22 million cubic metres of gas a day, and electricity generation equivalent to nearly 4,500 megawatts, the pipeline would be able to meet nearly all of Pakistan’s current electricity shortfall. Furthermore, compared to its current import from countries such as Qatar, Iranian LNG is far more affordable.\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, the IP gas pipeline can cement Pak-Iran relations and effectively thwart expanding Indian influence in the region. What’s more interesting is that in 2016, China expressed the desire to invest in the pipeline and expand it into its own borders. Iran welcomed Chinese interest and sweetened the deal by expressing interest in joining the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). If Iran joins, an unparalleled trifecta in the region could emerge, hence promoting development, peace and stability. Although it is too early to tell right now, initial willingness from different countries has shown that the IP gas pipeline could be a catalyst for extraordinary cooperation in the region and beyond.\n\nFor Iran, the IP gas pipeline could provide much-needed relief to its ailing economy. Crippled by years of brutal sanctions, Iran has failed to effectively monetise its abundant oil and gas supplies, and as a result, has suffered from abysmally low GDP figures. Notably absent from LNG and oil markets, Iran is missing out and is eager to establish itself as a force in the economic world. Moreover, Iran has lacked an iron brother-like alliance with any of its neighbours to assist in alleviating its crises. For example, Iraq is embroiled in constant turmoil and lacks stability for any strong alliance to emerge, while neighbours in the Caucasus do not see eye-to-eye with Iran. However, an economic alliance with Pakistan is not only stable and safe, but the market of 220 million people can provide ample opportunity for Iran to fulfil its economic needs.\n\nOver the past decades, an environment of trepidation and apprehension has developed in place of a potentially fraternal relationship between Pakistan and Iran. The two countries have continually looked away from one another, opting to search thousands of miles away for rather unsustainable and short-lived alliances. However, as Pakistan and Iran unshackle themselves from the constraints of geopolitics, they must look towards one another for a better future.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/image1654671439-0/image1654671439-0.png"}, {"headline": "Does gun control even matter to GOP members and the NRA?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97595/does-gun-control-even-matter-to-gop-members-and-the-nra", "date_published": "Tue, 07 Jun 22 11:29:25 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMass shootings are gaining renewed momentum across the United States (US) in light of the Texas school shooting and Memorial Day gun violence in Chicago. The former incident is said to be the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook. These are just a few instances of gun violence that get plastered all over the news, and rightfully so.\n\nAccording to Gun Violence Archive, there have been at least 246 mass shootings in the US so far this year, far more than the number of days passed in 2022. More than 2,000 American teenagers between the ages 12 to 17 have been shot dead or injured this year. There have been 8,346 gun-related deaths, 15,768 injuries and 634 unintentional shootings. Moreover, 473 children between ages zero to 11 years were shot during the first half of this year. What also appears to be gripping parts of the US are imitation mass murders. Following the Memorial Day shootings, there have been 13 others this past weekend, leaving more than a dozen dead and at least 70 injured. Gun violence is an act of terrorism that is encouraging repressed individuals to come forward and commit crimes openly.\n\nIt is critical to consider the complexity of America’s gun violence epidemic. Although mass shooters target innocent civilians at large, people kill in self-defense; they also commit suicide using weapons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2020, 54% of all gun-related deaths in the US were suicides (24,292). Therefore, gun violence should never be equated to mass shootings alone. The issue is more nuanced than we think.\n\nTake for instance the Covid-19 pandemic. It caused 45,000 deaths (suicide or homicide) by guns. These deaths can be partly attributed to loss of jobs, psychological strain and exacerbated mental illness that Americans experienced in 2020.\n\nThat said, gun violence in America continues to take an emotional toll on families, while gun advocates observe in silence. Gun advocacy is a big part of the problem to push for safer, smarter gun control measures. A vocal proponent of guns is Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who signed seven laws, making it easier for people to access guns, including individuals over 21 who can carry a handgun without license and training. Easier access to guns caused gun violence to soar in Texas, which has one of the highest numbers of mass shootings in the US. Last year, Texas saw a 65% increase in mass shootings.\n\nOn top of gun advocates and GOP (republican party) members backing their second amendment rights, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has an equally important role to play in politicising gun control. It is no surprise that the NRA uses funds to push its agenda forward, which is to support guns left-right-centre. They use heaps of money to sway the debate surrounding gun control in their favour. Numerous Republicans⁠, Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, Mitch McConnell, and a dozen others have benefited from the NRA in the past, including a law firm that has backed the association for years in exchange of $23 million.\n\nIn the wake of deadly mass shootings, it is unfathomable that the NRA would hold its annual meeting days after the Robb Elementary School massacre. This insensitive move demonstrates the NRA’s audacity to push for gun rights in a time when thousands of families grieve the loss of their loved ones. The association claims that it is “committed to making schools secure” but it is only in the guise of hypocrisy.\n\nAlthough democrat states including New York and California are making concerted efforts to counter gun violence through bills and gun buyback programs, these efforts will never budge GOP members. Schools, colleges, theaters and bars will continue to be targets of mass shootings because second amendment rights hold more value than human life in Republican states.\n\nSo, where is the middle ground if there is no solution to gun control at all? The key is to keep gun laws intact but changing the eligibility criteria of who qualifies to own a gun. A person with a history of mental illness should never have access to guns. This begs the question: how do you know someone is mentally unfit to own a gun? That is where running thorough background checks comes into play. These background checks can help curb a potential mass shooter from committing mass murder.\n\nIn addition, the legal age to own a gun should be raised from 18 years to at least 21. Right now, individuals 18 and older can be sold long guns, which is alarming given that two 18 year-olds were responsible for the deadliest school shootings in America (Sandy Hook and the recent Robb Elementary School shootings). Countries such as Norway, Canada, New Zealand and Australia managed to curb gun violence through smart gun laws. The rate of mass shootings has sharply declined in these countries. Perhaps the US should extract valuable lessons and parallel similar gun reform strategies, if not exactly the same.\n\nThe media plays a very essential role to get the word about gun control out to the public. If media agencies including digital, print and broadcast, set aside their political differences and harmonise to address gun violence and gun control, things can steer in the right direction. Media coverage of mass shootings across the country can raise more alarm about gun violence in America, which can lead to protests, political pressure and ultimately, some form of resolution.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/OHKOJWUK2FLT7FEKYXS47ABT3I1653551321-0/OHKOJWUK2FLT7FEKYXS47ABT3I1653551321-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Why developing countries should not reduce their reliance on fossil fuels", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97593/why-developing-countries-should-not-reduce-their-reliance-on-fossil-fuels", "date_published": "Fri, 03 Jun 22 09:57:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn just 24 days in 2022, an average American had produced more carbon than an average Pakistani would produce in the whole year. In just three days, an average Australian emits more carbon dioxide than his counterpart would do in the whole year in Niger. The video gaming industry in the United States (US) consumes more electricity than any country in Africa. Of the total 1.5 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere since the middle of the 18th century, 70 per cent has been produced by the US, China, Europe and Russia, with the US being the largest emitter by far. \n\nThese are some of the facts that reflect a wide gap between posturing by the rich countries of the world of being considerate of the environment and the deplorable ground reality.\n\nThe richest countries are home to half of the world’s population and emit 86 per cent of the world’s total carbon dioxide emissions. If we are to improve the climate and limit global heating to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, carbon emissions have to be curbed and more action is required from the rich and developed countries. Many in the developing world are of the opinion that the global north has already benefited from fossil fuels and now that it has all the means and resources to shift to cleaner energy, it is imposing the same on the global south where people are yet to attain a higher standard of living. Critical energy projects for less economically developed countries are being banned under the garb of environmental conservation.\n\nAt the 26th Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) held in 2021, more than 20 countries – including the US and some European nations – pledged to stop foreign fossil fuel financing while giving no indication of curbing their domestic production and expansion. Such two-faced actions do more harm than good: one, by pushing poor countries further to the brink; and two, by making a mockery of environmentalism and snatching away its true spirit and purpose.\n\nIn a similar move, China announced last year that it won’t build new coal-fired power plants abroad. China has been the major contributor to Pakistan’s coal-powered energy sector in the recent past. Pakistan has total coal reserves of more than 185 billion tonnes and ranks seventh among the countries with the largest lignite coal reserves. These reserves can ensure sustainable development by keeping the economic and social pillars of sustainability intact through empowerment, improved well-being and availability of opportunities for the present and future generations.\n\nDepriving the developing world of growth and development by curbing the supply of fossil fuels or by halting investments in fossil-generated energy projects will deteriorate beleaguered economies. It is important that the global south be allowed to follow the same path to development as the global north took, that is, by ensuring development through industrialisation, even if it came through the use of fossil fuels. Economic prosperity will, in fact, enable the availability of necessary resources and capital to protect another pillar of sustainability – the environment. This doesn’t mean that development will necessarily come at the expense of the environment. Environmentally-friendly fuel to energy conversion technologies can be used to mitigate harmful environmental impacts. Instead of curbing the funding of fossil-generated energy projects, the richer countries should invest in the use of less harmful methods of energy generation through fossil fuels.\n\nReadily available and economically viable energy options are the need of the hour for many developing countries like Pakistan, without which the achievement of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will remain a distant dream.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1080201-SmokestackinChinaCarbonemissionsAFPxx-1459978271/1080201-SmokestackinChinaCarbonemissionsAFPxx-1459978271.jpg"}, {"headline": "It’s not about being pro-abortion, it’s about being pro-choice", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97578/its-not-about-being-pro-abortion-its-about-being-pro-choice", "date_published": "Sat, 07 May 22 10:24:08 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSome interesting developments (or lack thereof) have surfaced about the abortion laws in the United States (US). Feminists who fought long and hard for a woman’s right to choose are turning in their graves after discovering that Justice Samuel Alito is considering overturning a landmark decision in the case of Roe v Wade, which sought to protect abortion rights in the US almost 50 years ago. An initial draft of the said move has been leaked. Even though this leaked draft is not the final verdict or opinion of the court, it has however sparked a serious wave of reactions and disappointment from abortion rights advocates. If the final call reflects the opinion draft, America will see a drastic shift regarding abortion rights in the country.\n\nFor anyone not already familiar with the original Roe v Wade, here is a quick description and a somewhat lengthy explanation about its significance for women’s rights. A landmark decision was taken in 1973 by the US Supreme Court that ruled that the Constitution of the US protected women’s liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restrictions. This decision ultimately opened up safe spaces and clinics for women who wished to have abortions done, with services provided by fully trained and licensed physicians. The decision ultimately explained that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution provides “a right to privacy” which protects a pregnant woman’s rights to choose. Furthermore, the court reasoned those outlawing abortions would violate a pregnant woman’s right to privacy for reasons such as:\n\n\n\thaving unwanted children would lead to a distressful life and future for the woman;\n\tit may cause long-term psychological harm which could result in poor care of the child considering the mother’s weak physical and mental health;\n\tand because there may be “distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child”.\n\n\nThe decision was celebrated by abortion rights advocates as this was a huge move towards recognising women’s rights when it came to making their own choices about their bodies. And why shouldn’t it be? The benefits of legalised abortion are plentiful – fewer illegitimate births, smaller welfare costs, less children born as a result of rape. However, according to Alito, the constitution makes no such reference to abortion and that no such right is implicitly protected by the constitutional provision.\n\nTherefore, the overturning of Roe v Wade would lead to stricter limits on abortion access largely in the South and Midwest, with about half of the states set to immediately enforce broad abortion bans. On the other hand, the following 16 states have laws in place to protect the right to abortion: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\n\nWhy this debate is causing such an uproar is not only because this is overall a huge setback for women’s right to choose what they want to do with their bodies but also the deep negative impact the ban will have (if implemented) on women who are prevented from obtaining abortions. Some of these adverse consequences include mental, physical and financial impacts. It has been proven in several studies that being denied an abortion is linked with an increase in anxiety, stress and lower self-esteem shortly after the denial. Women who are denied abortions also experience financial hardship, including an increase in household poverty considering there are additional mouths to feed and there are no strict laws around having the biological father provide child care support.\n\nIf abortion is to be banned and women’s bodies are to be controlled by a bunch of old white men, then perhaps they should also consider the consequences this will have on those very women, especially rape victims who have to carry the child of their abuser for nine months and then live with that trauma forever; while also being at risk of being contacted by the rapist for child custody or continued sexual violence and harassment. The ban would also greatly impact teenage mothers, sex workers and/or those women who become pregnant in cases of premarital and extramarital affairs. The fear of raising the child alone and being financially incapable of raising the child are of the top most reasons of pregnancy termination. Another very common reason for terminating a pregnancy is known as “young age pregnancy”, which ultimately would affect the young girl’s life negatively, while restricting her mobility and opportunities. Why is it that controlling women’s bodies and hindering their bodily autonomy is always up for debate, yet men’s accountability is hardly ever spoken about?\n\nA better draft opinion to read about would’ve been the US Supreme Court leaning towards providing free vasectomies for men. It’s a fairly painless and reversible process which does not cause any kind of long-term psychological or physical ailments. If men who get women pregnant can ‘choose’ not be part of the raising process, they should be encouraged to undergo the medical procedure so as to not cause pregnancies at all. The procedure can be reversed if and when they decide to have children consensually with their partner. But of course, restricting men’s bodily autonomy would be of the utmost disgrace and disrespect.\n\nAccording to Alito’s draft opinion, the idea that the abortion bans reflect the subjugation of women in American society is wrong considering women still have electoral and political power. By this logic, if women possess the right to vote or hold a public position, they should completely give up the right to decide what they want to do with their bodies because a few people who don’t even have a uterus can feel important about themselves. I wonder if these people who have decided to put these rights up for debates in the first place have even researched about the topic at all. It is actually quite obvious that despite the bans on abortions, they will continue to take place, only they will be unsafe and painful ones. Post-abortion care is essential for addressing disabilities caused by induced or self-induced abortions because they can surely be taken care of. However, the likelihood of women having access to post-abortion care and services will be practically zero in the states where the ban is to be implemented.\n\nThe US claims to be a superpower leading the world with its impeccable score on all fronts as a nation, but ironically their conservative ideas around minority rights have always remained questionable. These abortion laws are no different. Abortion is a reality, which is why it is essential that women be provided with affordable and easily accessible services without any pre-conceived notions and biases. The right to choose is a fundamental one and courts should challenge their abortion laws instead of executing bans that are only an attack on women’s freedom. If there is a ban which needs to be implemented immediately it is America’s gun laws which take more lives than abortions, with conviction rates of criminals at a disappointingly low rate, especially if the shooter is described as a white male. Pro-life advocates who are for the ban need to rethink their priorities and direct their energy into making more sensible arguments and fight for the justice of innocent children and adults who have been killed during school hours or in movie theatres by white American men who have the freedom to legally obtain a weapon over the counter, that too without a license or any understandable reason.\n\nThis is not about being pro-abortion, this is about being pro-choice, that no matter what your personal feelings or beliefs about abortion are, you understand it is not your place to make a decision for another woman about what she can and cannot do with her body.\n\nTo know where Pakistan stands on abortion laws, you can read my detailed piece here.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651920521-0/Cover1651920521-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Follow Riasat-e-Medina in Pakistan but not in Medina itself", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97576/follow-riasat-e-medina-in-pakistan-but-not-in-medina-itself", "date_published": "Sat, 30 Apr 22 10:01:34 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tYou know things have truly gone down the drain when local politics in Pakistan is unnecessarily taken out of context, literally, and used as a sorry excuse to spread hatred, ignorance, violence and blatant sexism. In the most recent case of embarrassing and shameful events, supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) went ahead and created complete havoc at Masjid-e-Nabawi without thinking twice about the historical and religious importance of the very ground they stood on.\n\nIn case they forgot, here is a quick reminder: Masjid-e-Nabawi is one of the most sacred places in Medina for Muslims. Considering Pakistanis have self-appointed themselves as the sole protectors of Islam for so long by protecting and defending blasphemy laws in the hope of punishing (even if wrongly) those who apparently disrespect Islam, this very act in Medina has proved that nothing – not even a place of worship during one of the holiest months for Muslims – can stop these devils from showing their true colours.\n\nThere is a nasty video being circulated on social media showing a bunch of men chanting slogans of “chor, chor” (thieves) at some members of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s delegation in Medina. Not only that, it is clearly visible and audible the highly disrespectful and profane language and slogans being hurled at the current Federal Minister of Information and Broadcasting Maryam Aurangzeb. Using disrespectful and disconcerting sexist slogans against women is so outdated but, since a patriarchal induced understanding of gender and culture plagues this country so deeply, this is hardly a surprise. Degrading and violating women has long been used as a tool and indicator of victory in wars, and this, it seems, is no different – especially since Imran Khan keeps comparing this whole political escapade to the battle of Karbala.\n\nThe harassment faced by various members of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) while performing their religious duties has raised eyebrows across the globe as Pakistanis are yet again being highlighted for their deranged actions. The sanctity of the holy mosque has been spoiled and there is no justification for carrying out dirty political agendas on holy sites.\n\nAs if the political garbage that we’re witnessing first-hand in Pakistan wasn’t enough, we are now a mere laughing spectacle for those nations whom we have tried to convince otherwise in the hopes of building amicable relations. As if our perceived association with terrorism wasn’t enough, this has added another feather to our embarrassment cap. If Imran set out to create a Riasat-e-Medina in Pakistan, perhaps he should give sermons to his followers on how to effectively follow the rules of Medina in Medina at the very least. It’s obvious that pre-planning this stunt did not go the way he wished. Sadly, and evidently, this cult mentality has brought politically blinded citizens to a point where they see nothing wrong with what they did. Many have not even bothered to condemn this awful incident, and the rest are still finding ways to justify it.\n\nYes, every citizen of a country should be well-aware and critical of the politics of their country and should be able to question their leaders whenever they see irregularities, injustices and/or discrimination taking place. But to be politically charged to this extent is very dangerous since some Pakistanis will export their violent and extremist attitudes to the countries which have allowed them in, further causing global isolation. These actions are mostly perpetuated by men, and usually women have to pay the price. But alas, when a so-called leader openly supports sexual harassers and believes in victim-shaming, one can hardly expect any wise, well-thought out and grounded decision-making.\n\nI am amazed at how effortlessly all of this has been planned and implemented. This particular incident reeks of misogyny and hypocrisy at all levels. It is obvious that this will destabilise and polarise the nation further, and will make violence an acceptable form of ‘protest’. The common saying “politics can be dirty” is an understatement in the case of Pakistan. Our politics is not only ours, it’s for the entire world to find entertainment in. But, more importantly, it is a disgrace to the religion we hold so dear.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651313943-0/Cover1651313943-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Are we on the brink of a global recession?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97575/are-we-on-the-brink-of-a-global-recession", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Apr 22 08:21:09 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSince Covid-19 brought the world to a halt in 2020, life has been nothing short of a nightmare. We have already seen unprecedented national lockdowns, social distancing measures, overburdened hospitals, and mass casualties all over the world. However, with the introduction of vaccinations, we assumed the horror was finally over, but nothing could be farther from the truth. With inflation on the rise, widespread supply chain bottlenecks, and rising geopolitical tensions, governments face a monumental task in steering their countries away from a crisis. Looking at the current global situation, it is clear that we are in deep waters and may be on the verge of a global recession.\n\nWith economies all over the world reopening and consumers returning to markets, the main issue that central banks are dealing with is rising consumer prices. To combat inflation from rising any further, central banks started winding down their quantitative easing measures put in place at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, these measures were rendered ineffective due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which exacerbated global supply chains and drove commodity prices to historic highs, adding fuel to the already raging fire.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict has been detrimental to oil and gas prices, which have risen sharply. Furthermore, the two countries are large exporters of agricultural commodities, and account for nearly 14% of global wheat trade. Similarly, Russia and Ukraine account for nearly 19% of global barley exports and nearly 52% of global sunflower oil exports.\n\nIt is also important to note that, because Russia is a major fertiliser exporter, sanctions against the country could have a negative impact on fertiliser supply around the world, lowering crop yields. Russia is also a major supplier of valuable minerals such as palladium, titanium, nickel, and neon. Palladium, in particular, is a critical component in automobile manufacturing, and its price has increased astronomically since the war began. Supply disruptions in these commodities from Russia and Ukraine have driven up consumer prices even further.\n\nAside from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, China’s zero-Covid policy is causing mayhem in commodity supplies all over the world. The imposition of strict lockdowns and travel restrictions is harming demand and economic growth in the world's second-largest economy. Shanghai, the world’s busiest container port, is closed due to an uptick in coronavirus infections in the region. As a result, hundreds of cargo ships have been stranded in the port.\n\nMoving forward, China's return to a Covid-zero state is highly unlikely given the likelihood of new coronavirus variants emerging in the future. As a result, the global economy is predicted to stay under pressure, at least in the short term, and inflation is expected to continue its upward trend, forcing central banks to continue hiking interest rates until the global macroeconomic outlook stabilises.\n\nConsequently, given the Russia-Ukraine war and the slowing down of China’s economy, policymakers around the world are considering the likelihood of the global economy entering into a recession. According to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the growth of the global economy will drop to 2.8% in 2022. Earlier, it had predicted that the global economy would expand by nearly 4.1% before Russia declared war on Ukraine. Similarly, as per WoodMac, a research and consultancy company, the global economy is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2022 and 0.7% in 2023.\n\nInvestors around the world are already tweaking their strategies and becoming more cautious as uncertainty in global markets continues to rise. This is clear from the inversion of the American Treasury yield curve, which indicates that investors are shifting away from risky equities and towards short-term fixed income bonds in an attempt to protect themselves from the possibility of the global economy slowing down in the short term. Furthermore, fund managers around the world are also increasing the weightage of cash in their portfolios.\n\nConsidering the aforementioned warning signs such as rising inflation, inversion of the American treasury yield curve, and portfolio reallocation by global fund managers, the likelihood of the global economy entering a recession in the short term is high. Hence, countries are at a critical juncture where policymakers must be proactive in dealing with the looming issues, and governments should be actively seeking for ways to protect their respective countries from the implications of a global recession.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651134728-0/Cover1651134728-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "From India to Bharat", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97566/from-india-to-bharat", "date_published": "Wed, 06 Apr 22 10:18:47 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIf centuries of plunder in the subcontinent, communal rifts and destructive power struggles were someone’s fault, whose were they? Were they ours? Was it theirs? I’m still searching for the answers but what I do know is that our past divided us then and it continues to divide us now. The fact that Narendra Modi’s India is a polarised state practicing blatant discrimination of minority communal groups and economic classes isn’t news. Modi’s rise to power isn’t an anomaly; it isn’t just a chapter in India’s history – it's a carefully crafted manifestation of an ideology. \n\nHave you ever wondered how and why Jawaharlal Nehru’s “azaad” India has embarked on such a journey? How and why is the very nature of the world’s largest democracy being rebuilt? Is it really that bad?\n\nHindutva: who is a Hindu?\n\nWith the arrival of European missionaries in India, the practice of proselytism not only threatened the socio-religious structure of society, it also brought changes in its demography. To resist the new faith, Hindu reformers endowed their religion with egalitarian values through a reinterpretation of the – highly abstract in nature – Vedas. This led to the creation of a golden age of Hinduism which was then supported by movements such as the Arya Samaj. The 1919 mobilisation of Indian Muslims in support of the Caliphate of Constantinople – the Khilafat movement – solidified the “majoritarian inferiority complex” of the Hindus due to its Pan-Islamic nature.\n\nIt was in this context that VD Savarkar codified the Hindu nationalist ideology, citing four factors in determining the eligibility of a “Hindu” – race (Aryan decent and Vedic fathers), territory (Vedic land where the holy rivers flow), language (Sanskrit) and culture. Savarkar also pointed out the similarities between his definition of “who is a Hindu” and the Zionists. MS Golwalkar’s views on the topic went one step ahead. He believed that Muslims of India did not deserve “even citizen rights” in the Hindu state. Their only option was to either submit or leave. These were the narratives which led to the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1925.\n\nTowards BJP\n\nThe organisation which started off by combating communists grew into a tentacular Sangh Parivar over the years with numerous sector-based organisations that gradually saturated the social space. The aim of the Sangh Parivar is state formation, not mere state-building. RSS entered the political arena in the 1950s after Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination by an alleged member of the movement and a close aid of Savarkar. Undoubtedly a dark time in the RSS’s history, the national outrage led to the arrests of 20,000 Swayamsevaks and the outlawing of the organisation which Nehru saw as an “Indian embodiment of fascism”. The Bharatiya Janata Sangh (BJS) was created by Golwalkar in 1951 in response to these developments.\n\nIn the time leading up to Modi’s rule in Gujrat, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, formerly BJS) had garnered considerable support in India, capitalising on its role in the Ayodhya Movement which resulted in violent clashes between the Hindu and Muslim communities during the “Ram Yatra”. Since then, the BJP has emerged as a populist party in India’s ethnic democracy which is against any and all things it deems a threat to the RSS ideology. The BJP’s primary targets are Muslims and Indian secularism. Its more concealed motives include the continued socioeconomic repression of the other backward classes (OBCs) and the scheduled castes (SCs), together with a complete dismantling of the very ethos of India’s once renowned impartial institutions.\n\nA lesson in populism \n\nIf there was ever a book titled “populism for dummies”, an account of Modi’s rise to power is sure to make an appearance. A product of the RSS, Modi in a true populist fashion rose to power following the Gujrat riots. During this time, violence was promoted and validated against Muslims, the “other”, by Modi and RSS radicals in response to the Godhra tragedy. Communal differences were then exacerbated to a point of no return, and it is from here that Modi’s populism turned into national populism. His humble beginnings helped him connect with the masses on an unprecedented scale and his shrewdness coupled with charisma propelled him into the status of an “ideal”. He was at once borne out of a mythology yet remained rooted in reality.\n\nDistancing himself from the Muslims, Modi established himself as an “Emperor of The Hindu Hearts”. His economic policies accelerated the growth rate in Gujrat – albeit at the expense of the proletariat – which would later lead him to tout the “Gujrat Model” in his 2014 election campaign. Subsequently, in the 2000s, when Islamic terrorism was at its peak, Modi would find himself at the centre of assassination attempts supposedly sponsored by ‘jihadis’. It did not matter that there was a complete lack of evidence to support the claims that the Pakistani state was behind this supposed threat, or that the ‘jihadis’ arrested were later acquitted by the Indian courts. He had established his national populist repertoire – a feat which would get him elected as the prime minister for two consecutive terms.\n\nThe first term \n\nDuring his first term, Modi focused on raising the “self-esteem” and “dignity” of the Indian people by introducing programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jan-Dhan Yojana, and Ujjwala Yojana. While there were no concrete reforms to help raise the economic status of his newly created “neo-middle class” or the poor, he also scaled back on the previously launched pro-poor programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Modi’s urban consumer bias was apparent in the economic policies put forth which facilitated crony capitalism. He diverted the people’s attention by focusing on social justice and keeping communal violence brewing to appease his “angry young men” who had taken the law into their own hands primarily through vigilantism (The Bajrang Dal).\n\nThis constant cycle of fear of the “Other” converting into anger was apparent in the activities of the Gau Rakshak Dal. Moreover, campaigns against ‘love jihad’ and ‘land jihad’ further unveiled the anti-Muslim sentiments of not only the state but Indian society as well. In the larger scheme of things, Modi’s politics led to the banalisation of Hindutva, reformation of the education system in line with the RSS ideology, crackdown on secularists and free press, ‘reconversion’ campaigns, opening up the state apparatus to the RSS, and deterioration of India’s once revered institutions including the police, Supreme Court, media, and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\n\nModi 2.0\n\nBy the 2019 elections, India had already converted into a “De-Facto Hindu Rashtra”. Staying true to his saintly politics, Modi centered his campaign on an “external enemy” – Pakistan. The Balakot strikes following the Pulwama attack, together with Pakistan’s goodwill gesture of Wing Commander Abhinandan’s release were hailed as ‘victories’ in India. Interestingly, Bharat, by then, had embarked on a path towards electoral authoritarianism, thus the main opposition parties barely stood a chance.\n\nCapitalising off caste politics and plebian support for the “strong man”, the BJP, with the conquest of the Rajya Sabha, was now in a position to fulfill its primary objectives – the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the abrogation of Article 370. The Ayodhya verdict was the final nail in India’s secular identity. Christophe Jaffrelot thereby concludes that India is now an ethnic democracy wherein the Hindus are bound by racial, linguistic, religious or other such cultural characteristics. Their strong sense of identity is pivotal for the rejection of the “other” which isn’t protected by the government nor the international community.\n\nThe greatest divide \n\nIn a democratic structure, regardless of the adjectives, claiming to be ‘apolitical’ is perhaps the highest tier of ignorance. If democracy is a government by the people, for the people, and from the people, how can the two ever be separated? Of course, outliers do exist, but when a feat is present in majority, it becomes the norm. BJP’s anti-Muslim bias, RSS’s Hindutva ideology, and Modi’s populist politics exist and thrive in India, for the Indian people, by the Indian citizens, from the Indian society. India’s polarisation was triggered by deep-seated insecurities, and with multiple fears and numerous threats – real or fake – assimilation becomes the best course of action. While there is beauty in diversity, there is security in homogenisation. It looks like the people of India have chosen their rulers. Where this majoritarian rule leads Bharat will unravel a new chapter in the history of war itself – the Greatest Divide is yet to come.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1649243028-0/Cover1649243028-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "What should be on the OIC’s agenda?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97560/what-should-be-on-the-oics-agenda", "date_published": "Tue, 22 Mar 22 11:13:05 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) signed a charter in 1969 aiming for peace, solidarity and mutual economic development. One premium objective of the charter is the commitment of the states to following ‘International Law.’ The charter also profoundly adopts the fundamental freedoms, human rights and good governance for development as the core of the international policy system and organisational structure. Although criticised, another landmark development under the OIC system was the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, which complements the Declaration on Human Rights and other United Nations (UN) human rights instruments.\n\nFurthermore, the Astana Declaration as policy guidance for investment in science, technology, education and development is significant for the effective implementation of sustainable development goals or the development agenda of 2030. As the OIC is the second largest intergovernmental organisation after the UN, it was expected that it would be safeguarding Muslim rights and interests in the global policy system.\n\nHowever, the charter governing the 1.8 billion in the contemporary era of globalisation is still seeking an effective implementation plan because most of the developing and underdeveloped Muslim states are equipped with poor governance and mismanaged structures. The objectivity of the OIC in the developmental agenda counters the hegemony and individualistic approaches. As members of the OIC are currently meeting in Islamabad, it is worth considering what the OIC should aim to achieve over the coming years.\n\nThe member states of the OIC implemented non-interference in their internal matters and pursued secular interests over the developmental agenda. The war among a few Muslim States is one example. Foreign intervention is another. This simultaneously indicated in the past that Muslim states’ inter-relations in sub-systems cannot be translated into one big policy umbrella. The given issues also highlight the apparent reasons for not having any meaningful Muslim representation in the global policy system.\n\nThe pertinent question now is how the OIC, as the key representing the authority of Muslim states, can be effective in the global policy system. OIC theoretically attempted to portray itself as an organisation that upholds the ‘global Islamic agenda’, and that it is somehow similar to the UN instruments reflecting human rights, peace and sustainable development. To implement the human rights agenda effectively, the OIC must think about an organisational structure that may monitor and report to the authorities. There could be a multilateral court of justice following the regional judicial systems of Europe, Africa and South America.\n\nMore legitimisation of the OIC through establishing a meaningful ‘executive’ under the sub-state system shall present a robust approach towards implementing the local agenda of 2030. The OIC may also think about more sub-committees or sub-groups on diverse but common development policy programmes.\n\nAlthough it seems that the OIC has a limited role in the effective implementation of the agenda of Muslim states, the OIC may rethink how the local implementation of global agendas can help its voice in the global policy system. The OIC can bring together the states and people for common issues such as climate change, poverty eradication, human development and environmentalism.\n\nWhat is more prominent is that the initial establishment of the OIC emphasised the ‘Ummah,’ which may encompass the Muslim representation worldwide and welcome integration of other states with the Muslim population. More importantly, the affiliation in the OIC system as a non-observer state can be closely linked to present challenges of corruption, poor governance, unsustainable development, climate change and environmental crises.\n\nIt is undeniable that financial assistance is the only way forward for such agendas, and for such purposes, more extensive integration in the OIC of developed states cannot be avoided. So far, the challenges of inequitable growth and development are not addressed by the international policy systems and are unlikely to be resolved. The UN 2030 agenda has already suggested regional and sub-regional integration for common goals towards more considerable cooperation.\n\nIf the OIC is seeking an influential role in the sustainable development agenda of 2030, it should reframe its existing governance mechanism. The recognition of the future development agenda as suggested by the UN shall be recognised by the OIC and shall address the 17 primary goals for human development in the Muslim states. In doing so, the OIC must reconsider the assistance of policy experts, academia, social scientists, stakeholders and specific-area experts. Such initiatives will provide the OIC with valuable global representation.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1647948826-0/Cover1647948826-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "India’s institutionalised prejudice against Islamophobia", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97557/indias-institutionalised-prejudice-against-islamophobia", "date_published": "Fri, 18 Mar 22 10:35:30 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIndia recently called out the United Nations (UN) resolution which declares May 15th as the International Day to combat Islamophobia. TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, expressed concern that an emphasis on one religion takes away attention from the phobias against Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism. He states that India had offered sanctuary to Zoroastrians, Jews and others in the spirit of pluralism and expressed concern regarding the attack on gurudwaras (Sikh temples), the destruction of Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, and the glorification of the breaking of idols. Tirumurti further said he instead preferred the generic term religion-phobia to combat hatred against all religions.\n\nSuch a position was to be expected from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) India, which is bent on ‘decolonising’ the influence of past Muslim invaders by furthering the dharmic faiths (Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism) at the expense of demonising present-day Muslims and Islam. The fact that the ruling party remains strategically quiet when calls for genocide of Muslims are made is a testament to this observation. Scores of Hindutva trolls are usually out and about on Pakistani and other social media sites where they demonise Muslims and perpetuate their victimhood despite being an overwhelming majority in India. It is against this backdrop that the Indian representative brazenly projected his country’s institutionalised prejudice.\n\nHowever, Tirumurti conveniently failed to recognise and mention the systemic genocide of the Rohingya Muslims by Buddhists in Myanmar, the concentration camps of Uighurs in China, the mass destruction of Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq in a post 9/11 world that has led to the universal singling out of Muslims and Islam. He ignored the fact that two billion Muslims are often generalised and stereotyped as terrorists and that many Sikhs in the West are targeted not because of their Sikhism but because they are perceived as Muslims. In other words, the targeting of people of colour and Sikhs in the West is also because of Islamophobia.\n\nIt is true that Hindu girls face forced conversion in the Sindh province of Pakistan, but this oppression is unique to that province (based on feudalism) and is not found in Arab countries. Similarly, the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was perpetrated by the rogue Taliban and not other Afghans who have enjoyed good relations with India. In fact, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has recently facilitated the construction of a large Hindu temple as well. The same goes for Pakistan that unilaterally took steps to facilitate Sikh pilgrims to their holy sites in Pakistan. If anything, it was the Indian government that took draconian steps against Sikhs and the Golden Temple in the mid-80s.\n\nThe Indian representative mentioned the glorification of the breaking of idols, which is reminiscent of the past Muslim invaders from central Asia in the age of empires. However, those Muslim invaders from Persia, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and other central Asian places are long dead. It was a different time where human rights violations were perpetrated by anyone and everyone. The sacking of Baghdad by the Mongols is one such example. However, the BJP and its leader Narendra Modi seem fixated on the past and not on the present where their government has singled out and marginalised Muslims through the Citizenship Act.\n\nThe whatbaoutism of the Indian state in an attempt to deflect attention away from Islamophobia towards “religion-phobia” is clear for everyone to see. The words of Tirumurti remind us of those white supremacists who argue against “Black Lives Matter” by responding with “All Lives Matter”, or of those homophobes who argue against the Pride Parade by resorting to the inanities of “what about Straight Parade”.\n\nIt is time India stops comparing itself to Pakistan, which itself has huge issues of intolerance, and starts addressing its internal issues of the systemic discrimination and Hindutva calls for genocide of their own Muslim minorities.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1647603749-0/Cover1647603749-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistani migrants bounce back", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2370889/pakistani-migrants-bounce-back", "date_published": "Fri, 12 Aug 22 20:47:25 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe number of Pakistani nationals migrating for work mostly to the Gulf countries has bounced back to the pre-Covid-19 level to around 65,000 per month in January 2022 in the wake of rising income of oil exporting Arab countries and advanced economies around the world.\n\n“The monthly flow of Pakistani workers (abroad) has reverted to pre-Covid levels,” the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in its half-yearly report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for July-December of fiscal year 2021-22 released on Friday.\n\nOver 70% of Pakistani workers go to GCC countries mostly to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nThe number of migrating Pakistani workers plunged to zero during the initial five months of the pandemic – April-August 2020, according to the central bank’s report.\n\nThe normalisation of the flow of workers to foreign countries along with a surge in the income of oil exporting GCC countries indicates the inflow of workers’ remittances to Pakistan will remain steady at around “$32 billion in the current fiscal year 2023 compared to $31 billion in FY22”, Topline Research projected last week.\n\nAs many as 458,257 Pakistanis proceeded abroad for employment in the first seven months (January-July) of 2022. This translates into 65,465 in each of the seven months, according to the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment’s (BE&OE) official website.\n\nA record high number of 946,571 Pakistanis went abroad for employment in 2015, translating to 78,881 each month during the year, according to the Bureau.\n\nAccording to the SBP report, it took almost two years to normalise the monthly flow of Pakistani migrants for work to the Middle Easter countries to pre-pandemic level. It was January 2020 when around 65,000 Pakistani went abroad for job purposes last time before the outbreak of the virus in Pakistan in February 2020.\n\nThe central bank’s report said no word on the economic outlook for the current fiscal year 2023, as it usually does in its quarterly, half-yearly and annual reports. Instead, it gave an outdated outlook for the second half (January-June) of FY22.\n\nTo recall, the country achieved economic growth of 6% for the second consecutive fiscal year in 2021-22.\n\nThe central bank said in its latest State of Pakistan’s Economy report that the collection of revenue in taxes to the government increased notably, but mostly due to increased imports during the first half of the previous fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. \n\nFederal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) collection of revenue in taxes increased by 32% in the first half of FY22, notwithstanding somewhat slower growth in the second quarter (Oct-Dec FY22), as economic activities improved and general price levels rose as compared to last year.\n\n“However, most of this increase stemmed from import-related taxes, on account of the broad-based increase in import volumes, international commodity prices, and PKR (Pakistani rupee) depreciation,” SBP said in the report.\n\nThe government, however, sharply cut imports in the first month (July) of the current fiscal year 2022 to $4.9 billion to avert the risk of default on international payments ahead of the resumption of IMF’s extended $7 billion loan programme in last week of the current month of August 2022.\n\nThe imports had hit a five-month high at $2.3 billion in June.\n\nFinance Minister Miftah Ismail said the other day the curb on imports would remain in place over the next three to four-month to improve the country’s capacity to make import payments and foreign debt 946,571 repayments.\n\nThe import curtailment may compromise FBR collection of revenue in taxes in the three to fourth-month of low imports in FY23.\n\nFrom the perspective of the first half of FY22, the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) exhibited broad-based expansion, exports grew buoyant alongside growth in FBR taxes and Kharif crops recorded higher production, the central bank said.\n\nHowever, amid multi-year high global commodity prices, rising inflation and current account deficit posed a challenge as the year progressed, it said.\n\n“These pressures necessitated monetary tightening amidst other regulatory measures to moderate demand.”­­\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 13th, 2022.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/41660337318-0/41660337318-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Senate panel seeks details of PIA pilots", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2310861/senate-panel-seeks-details-of-pia-pilots", "date_published": "Fri, 16 Jul 21 06:16:48 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Senate Standing Committee on Aviation on Thursday sought details of the pilots working with the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and was briefed on the functions of the Aviation Division and its attached departments.\n\nThe committee meeting, chaired by Hidayatullah, reviewed working procedures, budget, number of employees, challenges faced by the Aviation Division and its subsidiaries and the performance of the institutions.\n\nAmong others, the meeting was attended by senators Syed Muhammad Sabir Shah, Faisal Saleem Rehman, Mian Raza Rabbani, Aun Abbas, Faisal Javed, Saleem Mandviwalla, Afnanullah Khan, Dilawar Khan and Sherry Rehman, besides Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Aviation Secretary Ali, Adviser to CEO PIA Amir Hayat, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Director General Flight Lieutenant (retd) Khaqan Murtaza, Airport Security Force chief security officer, Pakistan Meteorological Department director general and other senior officials.\n\nIt also looked into the measures taken by the Aviation Division to improve performance of the attached departments and its future plans to tackle challenges confronted on the professional front.\n\nIt was the committee's first meeting after its reconstitution followed by the Senate elections.\nHidayatullah said the committee proceedings would be made more effective with mutual consultation of the members so that the confronted issues could be removed in an efficient manner.

Kamran Ghulam\n\nKamran Ghulam may not be a household name yet since he hasn’t represented Pakistan national team till now, but people who follow domestic cricket closely know him as the next big thing.\n\nThe right-handed batsman, in the recently concluded Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, bettered the record for most runs in a single QeA Trophy season. The record, earlier held by Saadat Ali with 1217 runs, was broken by Ghulam in the final of the tournament where he was representing Khyber-Pakhtukhwa.\n\nHowever, this is not the only thing that pushed Wasim to include the 25-year-old in the squad.\n\nGhulam boasts a first-class average of over 53 with 31 matches to his name. He has scored nine 100s and 11 fifties to amass 2,413 runs, with a highest score of 166.\n\nIf he can build on his current domestic form when playing against South Africa, the visitors will find it hard to beat Pakistan in the two-Test series.\n\n2. Tabish Khan\n\nIf you’re a pacer outside Pakistan, you’ll probably start your career in mid or late-twenties and end it after your mid-thirties. However, right-arm medium pacer Tabish Khan will start his international career at 36.\n\nSome may say he was not international material, but with 598 wickets in 137 first-class matches, there is and there never was a valid reason to keep him out of the national fray. Well, he’s not the only one who had to wait a long time to get his chance, Fawad Alam is another case study in this regard too.\n\nThere is light at the end of every tunnel and Tabish had to travel miles to find his light and he would love to grab the chance with both hands when he bowls to the South Africans in Karachi and Rawalpindi in the two Tests.\n\nJury is out on whether he will be able to live up to the hype after spending his heydays in the domestic wilderness, but if Tabish wants to question a system which gives multiple chances to a few and nearly zero to some, he will have to utilise all the experience he has gained and get his first and maybe final hurrah on the international level.\n\n3. Saud Shakeel\n\nAnother youngster, with heaps of runs behind him and a first-class average of nearly 49, Saud Shakeel will don the greens of Pakistan during the two Tests against South Africa.\n\nAt the age 25, Shakeel has 3220 runs in his books in 46 first-class outings. He also has 10 tons and 17 fifties to boast about and if this is not enough, he can bowl left-arm slow.\n\nShakeel has come to the fore through the Pakistan cricket ranks and has played for the U19 team, which may prove to be a point in his favour as he had the grooming of a cricketer from an early age.\n\nAll in all, Pakistan have played a big gamble by benching their usual suspects and giving the domestic performers a chance to shine. This move may turn new chief selector Wasim into a hero that many were waiting for, however it can backfire too.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Kamran-Ghulam-PCB1611139704-0/Kamran-Ghulam-PCB1611139704-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "4 players who can help Pakistan beat New Zealand in third T20I", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2276840/4-players-who-can-help-pakistan-beat-new-zealand-in-third-t20i", "date_published": "Mon, 21 Dec 20 09:53:42 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan are against the ropes in the three-match T20I series against New Zealand as they’ve lost the opening two games and only a win in third shortest-format game can help them gain much-needed confidence when going into the Tests.\n\nPakistan stayed rigid in their approach and played the same elevens in the first two T20Is, but with the series already lost, it is high time Pakistan try something new on the field against New Zealand.\n\nWhile the option of chasing may present itself if Pakistan win the toss third time on the trot, a few changes in the eleven can also be beneficial for the stand-in captain Shadab Khan.\n\nHere are the three players who can walk in and help Pakistan win the third T20I against New Zealand.\n\n1. Sarfaraz Ahmed\n\nIf you ask a Pakistani cricket fan why Sarfaraz Ahmed was sent into the wilderness, even after taking Pakistan to the summit of the T20I rankings, they would not mention his batting, his wicketkeeping or his captaincy, but they’d rather blame it on him being a Karachi player.\n\nWhether this theory of the Pakistan Cricket Board being biased against Karachi players is true or not, one thing everyone can agree on is that Sarfaraz brings something to the field which many other players can’t – the much-needed energy.\n\nSarfaraz was famous for his animated and chatty wicketkeeping when he was captaining Pakistan in all formats and even though some may disagree, the energy he brought with his shenanigans was contagious.\n\nHim walking to the bowler before and after every delivery, his comments when someone dropped a catch or did a great job in the fielding, all of that is missed with Muhammad Rizwan behind the stumps.\n\nWith Shadab at the helm against a New Zealand side which he is finding very difficult to outwit, an experienced former captain behind the stumps can go a long way in helping Pakistan enforce a win when everything has failed to work.\n\n2 and 3. Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa\n\nWahab Riaz is not doing what he is supposed to do in New Zealand – be the experienced leader of the young bowling pack, and this gives way to Pakistan go for the young but express pace duo of Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa.\n\nInclusion of Musa can also help Shaheen Afridi take a much-needed rest before he is asked to run in and fire on all cylinders during the upcoming Tests.\n\nAlso, if Pakistan really want to make things interesting, they can always replace Haris Rauf with Iftikhar Ahmed. Iftikhar is considered to be a big-hitter, and also can bowl four overs of off-spin. Since New Zealand are perfectly fine when dealing with pacers, a spin of strategy may work in Pakistan’s favour.\n\n4. Usman Qadir\n\nWe all saw what the legendary spinner Abdul Qadir’s son Usman Qadir got from his father – a spin bowling masterclass.\n\nShadab has been off colour in the bowling department in the first two matches, maybe because of his increased focus on batting and recently captaincy and Usman can help fill the shoes of team’s first-choice leggie.\n\nIf there’s a question of who he should replace in the side, anyone between Khushdil Shah and Abdullah Shafique can give way to Usman, as many may still now know that he has the ability to bat quite nicely in the lower order.\n\nPakistan will be concluding their shortest-format series in the third T20I against New Zealand on Tuesday and they will need something new to surprise the hosts and make them submit. However, if they play safe and don’t make any changes, they will surely lose again, with dignity yes, but they will lose.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/comment1608542933-0/comment1608542933-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "3 reasons Pakistan lost first T20I against New Zealand", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2276467/3-reasons-pakistan-lost-first-t20i-against-new-zealand", "date_published": "Fri, 18 Dec 20 12:36:48 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThere was never a doubt that Pakistan would find it difficult to beat New Zealand at the latter’s home and the theory was proven true when the Kiwis beat Men in Green by five wickets in the first T20I of the three-match series on Friday.\n\nWith the defeat, Pakistan will have to pull up their socks for the next two T20Is if they want to salvage the series and win it.\n\nIt was also a sad day for Pakistan stand-in captain Shadab Khan who lost the very first T20I, where he stood as captain.\n\nA closer look of the first T20I shows there were a few things Pakistan could have changed or could have done to prevent the loss in the tour opener.\n\n1. No specialist openers\n\nPakistan won the toss and chose to bat first, but they missed the trick when they asked wicketkeeper-batsman Muhammad Rizwan and newcomer Abdullah Shafique to open the innings against New Zealand.\n\nUnfamiliar with the opening role, Rizwan lost his wicket due to a callous drive and a smart delivery by Jacob Duffy, while Shafique was found out in the second delivery he faced against the Kiwis. Shafique couldn’t fathom the bounce on the pitch and flighted one into the hands of mid-on fielder for an easy catch.\n\nWith the openers gone quickly, as has been the case for Pakistan since eternity, the middle-order, lacking the services of the great Babar Azam, fell like a deck of cards, thus the question of why did Pakistan go with two batsmen upfront who don’t understand the demands of the opener’s role.\n\n2. Batting failure (again)\n\nWith the openers gone, the onus fell on the middle-order to stabilise the innings, but a young Haider Ali was not up to the task. Here, once again, Pakistan did not think twice before sending him at the one-down position, where teams tend to send their best and most in-form batsman.\n\nHaider is all that and a little more, but he lacks the experience of playing at the third spot. However, the next best option to bat at number three, veteran Muhammad Hafeez, did equally bad in batting after being dismissed on the very first ball he faced.\n\nAll thanks to Shadab’s 42 off 32 and a late flurry by Faheem Ashraf, who scored 31 off 18, Pakistan were able to put up a fighting total, but if the top and upper middle-order would have added an extra 20 or 30, the match could’ve shifted in the visitors’ favour.\n\n3. The Wahab dilemma\n\nTo play him or not to play him has become one of the major questions Pakistan faces whenever they go out in the field. If Afridi’s is the pinnacle of mercurial batting, Wahab is all that in the bowling department.\n\nOne day, he would pluck the moon out of the sky for Pakistan and the next day he would turn a certain victory into a miraculous defeat. Is it just bad luck, or is it just his bad bowling at some points, no one can truly answer.\n\nThe latter happened on Friday, when Wahab gave away 45 runs in just 3.5 overs after being hit for two sixes and five fours. New Zealand batsmen were bamboozled in the middle of the innings by some top-notch bowling by Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Faheem Ashraf, but Wahab leaking away runs gave New Zealand the much-needed confidence.\n\nAnd if all that was not enough, Faheem dropped a catch off Wahab at fine leg and to add insult to injury, let the ball crawl away for a four.\n\nIt is quite evident now that people are prone to dropping catches off Wahab’s bowling at fine leg and square leg region. Everyone would remember the disastrous drop in the 2015 World Cup by Rahat Ali where Wahab had setup Shane Watson perfectly with world class short-pitched bowling.\n\nSo, do we curse the man or do we curse his luck, at least I can’t answer this dilemma.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/comment1608294842-0/comment1608294842-0-68779.jpg"}, {"headline": "3 reasons Pakistan will find it difficult to beat New Zealand", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2274087/3-reasons-pakistan-will-find-it-difficult-to-beat-new-zealand", "date_published": "Mon, 30 Nov 20 07:44:32 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan contingent is currently in quarantine in New Zealand as they prepare for face the hosts in three T20Is and two Tests, and there is only one thing that is certain in the current uncertain Covid-19 time – it won’t be easy to beat the Kiwis.\n\nHere are the three main reasons why Babar Azam can return winless, in the series and in all the T20Is and Tests, from New Zealand.\n\n1. Bad morale\n\nAfter news of Pakistani players testing positive surfaced, the team must have seen a fall in their morale as, according to reports, many first team players were affected with the virus.\n\nThis could have led to drop in motivation, while a warning to send the whole squad home after some players breached the Covid-19 protocol was also not inspiring.\n\nPakistan players may be pumped up to beat New Zealand in the latter’s own yard after such humiliation, but with players in gloomy isolation, losing hope and feeling down may be the most probable outcome of the saga.\n\n2. Lack of fitness and practice\n\nEveryone knows about Pakistani’s love for food and our cricketers are just humans. With nothing much to do in hotel rooms, food might be the only entertainment they’ve had through the first half of their quarantine. Hence, a lack of practice may cause lethargy when they hit the ground.\n\nAll this may result in lack of efforts in the field and as the adage of catches win matches goes, a few slipups are a possibility too.\n\nPakistani players will have to put some extra yards in before the matches, otherwise, if they do just enough, the performances will also be just enough and New Zealand will roll over the Men in Green with ease.\n\n3. New Zealand’s form\n\nNew Zealand may not have won many global cricketing tournaments, but they are not known for their big trophy cabinet, they are known for their consistency.\n\nIf they are not the best on a given day, you can surely expect them to be at their minimum best at least. Meanwhile, their opponents Pakistan are known to be the most mercurial cricketing side in the world – “one minute down, next minute up”.\n\nIt is this consistency in New Zealand’s performance that makes them a difficult side to beat and add home advantage to that and it becomes a perfect recipe for Pakistan’s destruction in the series.\n\nAlso, they are unbeaten in the T20Is in the series against West Indies. Their form can be seen in the fact that they have scored quickly in the first two matches, setting a 239-run target in first and chasing a 180-run target in just 16 overs in the second.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistani players last played cricket during the remaining matches of the PSL5.\n\nMomentum will be on New Zealand’s side when they host Pakistan, first for T20Is and then for Tests. Babar will have to come up with a magical formula to lift the spirit of the players who will be feeling under the weather, homesick, and also out of form and practice. If the skipper can do that then he may not only go on to become a batting legend, but also a captain whose name would be written in golden words.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Comment1606722149-0/Comment1606722149-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Is Trump right in saying ‘India is filthy’?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2270253/is-trump-right-in-saying-india-is-filthy", "date_published": "Wed, 28 Oct 20 13:11:05 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhile the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden produced fireworks, Trump’s remarks in the environmental context that “India is filthy”, became a matter of heated debate within Indian media. Indian social media went berserk and its reaction also became prominent on mainstream media. Some went on to ask Trump for an apology on these remarks, which most of Sanghi trolls thought had hurt millions of common Indians.\n\nWhile any nation would react to such remarks from any leader of global stature, Trump’s remarks had a profound effect as Mr Modi has done a lot of work to develop a personal relationship with Trump through the “Howdy,Modi!” rally in the United States and “Namaste Trump” programme duringTrump’s visit to India this year.\n\nWhile we respect Indian sentiments, it may be interesting to conduct an analysis of where does India stand in terms of cleanliness and environment.\n\nAccording to IndiaSpend’sState of Global Air 2020 report,116,000 infants died in India due to air pollution in 2019 — meaning one infant died every five minutes due to air pollution. The data further reveals that 1.67 million Indians died in 2019 due to air pollution causes.\n\nAs per a World Health Organisation report, approximately 120,000 children under the age of five years die due to diarrhoea every year. This indicates that waterborne diseases are rampant in India due to contaminated water and poor sanitation.Hookworms, which can spread through open defecation, cause diarrhoea, anaemia and weight loss in women, according to the report. These problems are linked to low birth weight and slow child growth — 38% of children in India under five are stunted, according to the National Family Health Survey data.\n\nThe Indian magazine, The Wire, reported in 2017, that India, the world’s second-largest country by population, had the highest number of people (732 million) without access to toilets. The report by WaterAid, titled “Out Of Order: The State of the World’s Toilets 2017”, further stated that 355 million women and girls lacked access to a toilet. If they were to stand in a line, the queue could circle the Earth more than four times.\n\nThe problem is that Modi’sSwachh Bharat or Clean India programme built millions of toilets at avery fast pace across Indian landscape; however, these have become dilapidated and unusable,adding to the problem. Adding to that is the factor of demographics: Indian population has grown from 1,330 million in 2017 to 1,380 million in 2019, that’s an additional load of 50 million. So even if India builds one million new toilets every year it cannot match the pace of population growth.\n\nA CNet report published on September 11, 2020, states that India spent $30 billion to fix its broken sanitation. It ended up with more problems. The Swachh Bharat mission, launched in 2014, was an ambitious effort to stop open defecation. It's far from reaching that goal.Lack of enough water to use in Swachh Bharat was bound to make it a failure. Imagine a community toilet built for 500 people in a cramped city with irregular or no supply of water. Within a week, it will not only become unusable but also become a source of disease spread. A survey of open source pictures and videos of Swachh Bharat toilets in overpopulated cities indicates that this grand programme has become a virtual dustbin.\n\nIn 2019, India was also home to 21 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities, studies say, based on air-quality data. Coal usage in power generation stands at a whopping 75% and coal is notoriously bad for environment. No wonder New Delhi maintains the record of being the most polluted capital of the world for the second consecutive year. Even drinking water of the Indian capital is contaminated, The Hindu, in 2019,sarcastically remarked, “If it wasn’t enough that Delhi air is among the world’s most polluted, a new study has now shown that the city’s tap water is the most unsafe among 21 states within India.”\n\nIndian rivers have become almost toxic due to overpopulation and flow of sewage and industrial waste into rivers which hug large cities.Oceanplasticcleanup.com conducted a study of the most filthy, polluted and toxic rivers in the world called the “Dirty Dozen”, and lo and behold, India gets another honour with the Ganges as the second most polluted river in the world and Yamuna as the fifth filthiest.\n\nThe Ganges has a perennial problem of religious rituals.Gangapollution.com keeps a watch on issues related to it. One of its report highlighted the pollution in Indian rivers: many parts of the Hindu faith revolve around the Ganges River, who they believe is the form of the goddess Mother Ganga on Earth. Because of this, many people’s bodies and ashes are placed in the river. Large amounts of ashes from crematoriums along the Ganges River in Varanasi are dumped in each year. Majority of Hindus are cremated and placed in the river after being burned by Dalits along the ghats leading into their goddess’ body. These ashes are keeping the river from being clean.\n\nDead bodies are also a huge pollutant to the already dirty water, with 35,000 bodies estimated to be discarded into the river,yearly. This is huge amount of dead people to be floating in an important source of water for millions of people. Many times, international observers have pointed out to the Indian government to take effective measures for respect of human remains as pictures of human bodies floating in the Ganges River surface almost every month.\n\nOther than air pollution, poor sanitation, filthy rivers and water contamination, India stands tall in noise population as well.A LiveMintreport on noise pollution in India describes an alarming picture.\n\nThe red light at a traffic junction is the universal sign for vehicles to stop — but in India, it is also a signal to start something else: relentless honking. When noise from constant honking is added to the general cacophony in cities, it becomes noise pollution — and this pollution can be costly and dangerous too.\n\nKnops.co conducts regular surveys of noise pollution across the globe. Its 2018 report puts India in the top noise polluted countries in the world. The Worldwide Hearing Index was created some time ago by digital hearing app founders, Mimi Hearing Technologies GmbH. They analysed the hearing test results of 200,000 of their users. They combined their results with data on noise pollution from WHO and SINTEF, a Norwegian-based research organisation, and used it to plot noise pollution in 50 different cities. The top five cities with the worst noise pollution include Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nTo conclude, President Trump may have casually mentioned ‘filthy India’, referring to environmental issues without much attention to research and scientific evidence, but he has been proven right. India tops the list of the most polluted countries in the world in sanitation, water, air, hygiene and even noise.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2182545-adeelanaureennew-1584984008.jpg"}, {"headline": "Why we need fear for effective disaster risk reduction", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2268212/why-we-need-fear-for-effective-disaster-risk-reduction", "date_published": "Tue, 13 Oct 20 13:18:35 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tToday is the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and living in a time of a global pandemic, the need to prioritise disaster risk reduction has become resounding and all too very real as almost every person and community is suffering from institutional and socio-economic lack of preparedness. \n\nPandemics are not new. Scientists and historians have been warning against a global novel virus for the past few decades. Beating their beakers and drums, trying to raise awareness among governments and businesses that this is not of a matter of if, but when. When the Ebola outbreak wreaked havoc in West Africa, the US State Department, under then president Barack Obama’s administration developed a comprehensive guide in dealing with and mitigating infectious diseases. This was of course completely thrown out by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nOn October 8, just a few days ago, Pakistan saw the clock tick to 15 years since the devastating earthquake of 2005. Pakistan bore colossal losses then. Nearly 20,000 children died while they were attending classes. In total, about 85,000 people died, another 140,000 injured and 3.5 million became homeless as 0.6 million houses were severely damaged.\n\nPakistan’s north was particularly devastated and Balakot, the epicentre, was destroyed in a matter of seconds and 15 years on is still struggling to re-build infrastructure and lives. There is hardly any significant rehabilitation or reconstruction. Rather, the funds that were allotted for Balakot’s rehabilitation have been redistributed to the Benazir Income Support Programme(BISP) and Covid-19 Emergency Fund. This speaks to how ill-prepared our DRR is, that funds for one disaster are siphoned for others.\n\nDRR is an incredibly lofty goal for a country that cannot rehabilitate its citizens from disasters that took place almost two decades ago. Pakistan is not the only country unable to learn from past mistakes and lack of preparedness. As stated above, the US, and rather most countries during the Covid-19 pandemic have proven the amnesia that collectively surrounds us when it comes to the destruction of disasters.\n\nDanish philosopherSørenKierkegaard makes a distinction between the concept of dread and fear calling attention to fear as having an object, a definable threat that we can identify. Whereas, dread is a response shrouded in unknowns, is speculative, not belonging to parameters or definitions. \n\nWe are unequivocally living in a global time of fear. We fear the coronavirus, we fear loss of jobs, lives, travel, routine, any semblance to the “old normal”. Our fear is driving conversations and changes around the “Great Reset”: how can this disaster be learned from in such a way that we build back the world, better?\n\nWhat can be changed about the status quo that protects citizens beyond economic and political interests? \n\nHow can this ‘new’normal truly be transformative and inclusive?\n\nFear’s object allows for these conversations to have actionable points and attainable goals. Fear makes having a game-plan easier. Fear divides people into groups of: ‘part of the solution’ or ‘part of the problem,’ as is evidenced by corona-shaming of non-mask wearers and political leaders who had to retract fake news and disinformation.\n\nDRR for objects of fear, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, is timely and due to its global nature, which unlike Ebola which was predominantly contained within the context of “poor” countries, Covid-19’s fear is ubiquitous and has spread to contexts that are not used to suffering —‘developing country’ailments. The politics of fear is also always at play. Who is fearful,who is bearing the brunt of the threat is always imperative. Thus, DRR for infectious diseases is at the forefront of the priority list and perhaps, rightly so.\n\nDread on the other hand, is objectless, casting anxiety far and wide without aim and thus, is much more insurmountable than fear. Many of us dread climate change in an abstract way. We hear the news of sea levels rising. We notice the irregularities of the seasons. We breathe in toxic air like it is a non-negotiable aspect of nature. We watch gut-wrenching clips of starving farmers and drowning residents. \n\nOften though these realities are not directly our own. The dread and threat of climate change is still far away, neatly tucked away somewhere in the future. This is why business-as-usual is the state of affairs when it comes to the economy, government, consumer behaviour and social order. \n\nDRR for dread does not have the same timely impact as DRR for fear.\n\nUnlike DRR for infectious diseases, DRR for climate change is failing to account for human, social and political disaster amnesia.\n\nWhen dread turns to fear, as one may have experienced during the recent floods that engulfed Karachi and other parts of the country, there is suddenly an actionable sensibility that grips citizens and governments alike. Especially when those citizens were elites and urbane. The problem solving caps come on as people are united against a common threat.\n\nHowever, as human populations have made unprecedented exponential advancements in the last three decades, the myriad of threats have also of course, multiplied. Existential threats such as Artificial Intelligence, climate change, cyber warfare, pandemics, to name a few, have caused mounting existential dread invariably leading to inertia of sorts.\n\nI guess the trillion dollar question is: how do we capture what we know about the difference between fearand dread to formulate and implement DRR that works with the psychology and sociology of communities and countries?\n\nThis year, the theme of the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction is governance which is defined as the measure by which“lives are saved, reduced numbers of disaster-affected people and reduced economic losses. Covid-19 and the climate emergency are telling us that we need a clear vision, plans and competent, empowered institutions acting on scientific evidence for the public good.”\n\nUnfortunately, we are all still enveloped in a fear-centric mode of thinking when it comes to DRR. For instance, Prime Minister Imran Khan has recently approved the construction of high-rise buildings in Islamabad. This is problematic for several reasons from a DRR and urban planning perspective.\n\nFirstly, contrary to popular opinion, high-rises are not green solutions. In fact, high-rises encourage vehicular clutter causing serious damage to both environment and humans alike, by increasing air pollution. Vertical urban sprawl wreaks havoc on air quality. \n\nSecondly, high-rise buildings are energy-intensive as glass is simply not very good at keeping excessive heat out, or desirable heat in. Even with technological advancement, the amount of power it takes to keep high-rises going poses a huge opportunity cost to greener solutions. \n\nLastly, Pakistan has many seismic zones and as many high-rises are vulnerable to earthquakes and not always structurally sound, the proliferation of high-rises in the country can pose mammoth near-future risks. Furthermore, high-rises, pose evacuation concerns. If you live or work in a high-rise apartment, you'll face a harder challenge trying to evacuate due to emergencies, such as natural disasters or fire.\n\nIt is said, “earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings do,” which begs the question why is our government taking urban planning measures that are increasing disaster risks rather than reducing them?\n\nOur Prime Minister has repeatedly said, “ghabrana nahi hai (don’t get scared)”; but, when it comes to disaster risk reduction, it would be very wise to be fearful.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Mavra-Bari1602595736-0/Mavra-Bari1602595736-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Public complaints", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2265484/public-complaints", "date_published": "Thu, 24 Sep 20 19:06:54 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn order to further facilitate the public and speed up redressal of their grievances, the government plans to link up all complaint management systems of federal ministries with the Pakistan Citizen Portal. Prime Minister Imran Khan recently issued instructions in this regard. All existing 33 complaint cells of federal ministries will be connected with the centralised complaint system. The PM’s Performance Delivery Unit (PMDU) will decide the modalities in consultation with relevant institutions and devise integration plans. The PMDU has been asked to complete the process within 60 days. The idea is to avoid delays resulting from a multiplicity of complaint cells and duplication of efforts thereby undertaking the process of complaint rectification on a fast track basis. This will also save time and resources. The purpose is to put in place a universal system with many-faceted connectivity features for a comprehensive global grievance redressal mechanism.\n\nThe centralised system will help citizens avoid confusion as now a number of complaint cells are functioning causing problems to both the people and government functionaries working for redressal of public grievances. The integrated system will help eliminate the delays involved in manual processing of complaints. It will bring the whole process of receipt, processing, and removal of complaints under one window, and help citizens get information about the status of their complaints and things related to them. The PCP started functioning as part of the PMDU from October 2018. During the past two years, as many as 28 million people have registered 115,000 complaints, on average, every month, with it. According to official figures, 2.2 million complaints have been resolved with 40% confirmed satisfaction. The rural population might not be getting the facility of the online PCP because of the unavailability of internet services in villages and small towns. This needs to be rectified.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, September 25th, 2020.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "Jodhpur killing", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2265483/jodhpur-killing", "date_published": "Thu, 24 Sep 20 19:06:21 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistani Hindus have begun protesting against the Jodhpur incident as well as the hardships faced by members of the minority community that migrated to India in search of a better life. The false dreams that many of them have are regularly shattered by the harsh reality of India’s still-strong caste system, which rarely allows lower-caste Hindus to rise. Many of the Pakistani Hindu migrants are from those lower castes. For this, they often end up having to wait for decades to be allowed to become citizens of a country that claims to welcome all Hindus.\n\nPakistan Hindu Council Patron-In-Chief Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani made a much more explosive claim that Indian intelligence agencies have been forcing Pakistani Hindu migrants and tourists to speak against Pakistan and even killing people who refuse to do so. As evidence, Vankwani referred to the last month’s case of 11 members of a family who died under mysterious circumstances in the Indian city of Jodhpur in Rajasthan. The family had moved there years ago, motivated by those same false promises of a better life in India. Instead, they ended up being poisoned in their home.\n\nThe case itself is interesting for the secretive manner in which India has acted. The family of subsistence farmers was clearly not spies, yet India has refused to share any investigation details with Pakistan or allowed access to the survivors, even though they all were still Pakistani citizens at the time they died.\n\nVankwani implied that this was because a surviving family member had nominated the RSS and the ruling BJP in the police report. He also noted that no arrests had been made in the case which is extremely concerning.\n\nAfter decades of throwing accusations about the treatment of Hindus in neighbouring Muslim countries, India has shown that it is just as dangerous. We would think that now, at least New Delhi would try to show that it takes justice for dead migrants seriously.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, September 25th, 2020.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "Money in politics", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2370411/money-in-politics", "date_published": "Wed, 10 Aug 22 18:08:20 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tCalls for reforming the political financing system, including oversight, have been growing ever since the Election Commission of Pakistan’s probe findings regarding the PTI’s foreign funding case have become public. However, while many of the more prominent voices making those calls may appear to have a direct stake in the game — such as the PTI’s political rivals — the truth is that rumours have surrounded the finances of most other major political parties as well. Contrast that with political activists and others who have been calling for reforms for decades, yet have been largely ignored by the powers that be. \n\nClean elections and good governance should not be partisan issues. Unfortunately, failure to update election and political financing laws, or even enforce existing ones, is a collective failure of the political parties and the bureaucracy because it deprives citizens of their basic rights, while also ensuring that truly independent candidates from middle-class or poor backgrounds just can’t compete with the big guns. But maybe that is the point — securing the positions of the ruling elite while also ensuring that they stay in line. \n\nOver the weekend, open government and election transparency advocates at the Free and Fair Election Network , or Fafen, also brought up how political parties inside and outside the parliament need to strengthen regulations to limit the ability of big spenders to virtually buy elections, warning that free-spending without consequences deprives citizens of the right to contest elections and skews results towards big spenders, regardless of whether they are backed by billionaires or smaller, individual donors. \n\nThe weaknesses in the system begin with the current iteration of the law governing elections — the Elections Act of 2017. The act is astoundingly weak in its grants of regulatory power, and can be directly blamed — along with its authors — for allowing the 2018 general election to turn into the biggest spending polling cycles in the country’s history, even when inflation is taken into account. Bye-elections and local bodies polls conducted since then have also seen unprecedented spending, effectively consolidating power among the ultra-rich, whether directly as candidates or through the political parties they bankroll. Strongly enforced spending caps can be problematic in bigger constituencies and areas with higher advertising costs, but they are still probably the easiest place to start. \n\nDonor transparency is another area which needs to be investigated. This could be done through a public database which parties and candidates must regularly update with every political donation received and details of how funds are spent. The same would also apply to private groups and individuals financing political campaigns. Criminal penalties, as long as they are fairly applied, would be more than enough to change the face of Pakistani electioneering, certainly making it cleaner and, hopefully, a little more representative.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 11th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "PDM fiddles while the economy burns", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369873/pdm-fiddles-while-the-economy-burns", "date_published": "Sat, 06 Aug 22 18:44:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe only thing seesawing faster than the Pakistani rupee right now is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s political capital. So, here’s a contrarian take on what’s happening to the Pakistani economy. The real crisis is one of confidence, and not just economic fundamentals. Consider this: Pakistan faced a similar economic crisis at the beginning of PTI’s term and then again at the beginning of Covid-19. In both cases, stability and economic growth were restored. In fact, unlike most countries where public debt rose significantly during Covid-19, we were able to reduce our public debt-to-GDP ratio by about five percentage points through Covid-19. So, why does this economic crisis feel like the end of the world?\n\nThe underlying crisis of confidence this time is rooted in politics versus economics. Let’s unpack the previous economic crisis Pakistan overcame to contextualise this one better. To simplify, PTI’s core challenge in 2018 was inheriting an unsustainable current account deficit with the country standing on the brink of dollar default, while PML-N’s core challenge was to reverse fuel subsidies. The first two years of PTI’s government were hard for our economy because PML-N gave an ailing economy to Asad Umar. \n\nThe primary challenge was a current account deficit of $20 billion thanks to Dar’s fixation on keeping the rupee artificially overvalued versus the dollar. An artificially high rupee meant it was cheaper to import things than to produce them in Pakistan or export goods. Hence, our industry hollowed out, exports declined during PML-N’s tenure and imports we couldn’t afford thrived, bringing us to the verge of bankruptcy when PTI took over. \n\nPTI took politically unpopular but wise decisions to correct these sins, including the painful devaluation of the currency. The idea was they would rescue the economy first, then stabilise and then put it on the growth path. Halfway through stabilisation, Covid-19 hit. Despite Covid-19 though, Pakistan clocked in growth at over 5% over the last two years. This was so good that PML-N argued last year that the numbers had been fudged by the PTI government, only to validate growth numbers this year after over-throwing the PTI government. PML-N even used these healthy growth numbers to secure the latest IMF deal. \n\nHowever, when the PML-N was strategising to overthrow PTI through a vote of no confidence, their primary argument was that PTI was mismanaging the economy and a competent team was needed to restore order. Four months later, we are experiencing the fruits of labour from team competence, with the rupee nosediving and inflation skyrocketing. \n\nIn a provocative recent column, former State Bank Governor, Raza Baqir asks why this crisis feels more dramatic when the economic fundamentals are actually better than before: ‘Given that we successfully restored stability and growth in the recent two challenging crises, why is there not a shared sense of calm confidence that we should be able to do the same this time round? This question is particularly relevant because our reserves and public debt are better today than they were in the 2019 balance-of-payments crisis before the start of the IMF programme. At end-June 2019, our gross reserves had dipped to around $7bn; at end-June 2022 they were around $10bn.’\n\nHe goes on to argue about the central role politics is playing in this crisis. And the next logical question to ask is what is the core driver of the political instability in the country today? The answer to that question is simple, the vote of no confidence against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The irony is that while PDM brought a no-confidence motion against Imran Khan, it’s the Pakistani economy that’s expressing no confidence in the PDM government today. If there’s one lesson everyone can learn from this train wreck, it’s that civilian Prime Ministers should be allowed to complete their five-year terms for both political and economic stability.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 7th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131.JPG"}, {"headline": "Afghan humanitarian crisis", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369656/afghan-humanitarian-crisis", "date_published": "Fri, 05 Aug 22 18:34:35 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfghanistan has a long history of destruction and suffering, be it man-inflicted or natural. Since the Russian invasion in December 1979, Afghanistan has become a battleground of world superpowers and is surrounded by an unending wave of destruction.\n\nAfter the foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan, Pakistan hosted an exclusive Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference to discuss the Afghanistan issue. The conference focused on the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and exploring new avenues to address the rapidly worsening humanitarian situation in terms of food shortage and potential economic collapse. Foreign ministers of member countries, special invitees from the United Nations (UN), international financial institutions, and non-member states, including the US, UK, European Union, and Russia attended the session. Afghanistan’s delegation was headed by the acting foreign minister.\n\nPakistan’s initiative to host the 17th session of the emergency meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the OIC demonstrated Pakistan’s strong will to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan. All member countries unanimously agreed that peace and stability in the region can only be achieved by forming a broad-based and inclusive government that is representative of the entire Afghan society. \n\nDecades of conflict and instability in Afghanistan have left millions of people on the brink of starvation. Some 24 million Afghans were already in need of humanitarian assistance because of the economic crisis and lack of development aid. The situation was further exacerbated after the recent earthquake in Paktia and Khost, which left nearly 1,500 dead and many more injured. \n\nFollowing the earthquake, the Afghan government appealed for international support to address the crisis. The Pakistani government responded immediately by dispatching consignments of relief goods. On 22nd June, the first convoy of 8 trucks carrying tents, tarpaulin, and blankets from the National Disaster Management Authority reached Afghanistan. On 24th June, another consignment of relief assistance was sent through aircraft. Besides this, Pak-Afghan Cooperation Forum (PACF) also sent 5 trucks carrying 37.5 tons of food, winter bedding, tents, tarpaulins, and clothes. \n\nEarlier, PACF had also organised free eye camps in the hospitals in Kabul and Khost where thousands of Afghan patients were provided free treatment by Pakistani doctors. The forum also facilitated the first batch of Afghan children with congenital diseases who will receive free medical treatment in Pakistan. \n\nTo promote bilateral trade with Afghanistan, the Pakistani government decided to relax the visa policy to ensure long-term and sustainable trade between the two countries. Under the new policy, six months of multiple entry visas will be issued to transporters from Afghanistan. Pakistan has also decided to import coal from Afghanistan, which can help Pakistan generate cheaper electricity and save nearly $2.3 billion. \n\nSince August 2021, the economic crisis and collapse of the banking sector have made it extremely challenging to get money into Afghanistan. International humanitarian organisations and the UN have scaled up assistance to address rising needs, but aid cannot replace the services of the state. To institutionalise financial support, a trust fund was established at the OIC conference. However, the international community remains reluctant to allow cash inflow.\n\nDuring this difficult time, the international community must lift sanctions and release Afghan funds as the country has descended into a serious economic crisis. The international community must realise that this is not the time to settle scores or debate on issues of legitimacy or recognition. They must resume aid and support the Afghan people to mitigate their miseries. \n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 6th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Javed-Iqbal1659724580-1/Javed-Iqbal1659724580-1.jpg"}, {"headline": "Dialogue urged to end political uncertainty", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369231/dialogue-urged-to-end-political-uncertainty", "date_published": "Wed, 03 Aug 22 07:47:41 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tChief of Qaumi Watan Party (QWP), Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao on Tuesday while showing concern over current political state of affairs, suggested a grand dialogue for all political par-\nties to ease the situation.\n\nTalking to media persons, Aftab Sherpao said if a grand dialogue among political entities was not held, it would be harmful for the country and its economy.\n\nSuggesting two resolutions to end wrangling between the political parties, Sherpao said in politics the doors of negotiations and dialogue were never kept closed.\n\nHe said if Hasina Wajid and Khaleda Zia could sit on one table in Bangladesh for the sake of their country, then why the government and opposition in Pakistan cannot have reconciliation dialogue.\n\nHe said the political mercury which has touched the new heights of confrontation needed to be brought down through talks.\n\nThe confronting politics, he said, have also badly hit the country’s economy that was a matter of great concern and must be understood by the politicians.

Recently, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the Padma Bridge and declared it a ‘symbol of pride and capacity’. As early as 1992, Sheikh Hasina was involved in the economic issues and plans for Bangladesh. She undertook the task of balancing economic policies with political implications. Sheikh Hasina shifted focus from her father’s socialist agenda toward market-based capitalist growth. She learnt from other Asian countries whose economic success was based upon four pillars: political stability, social development, trade liberalisation with export-led growth and fiscal restraint.\n\nDuring a conference, when an economist began informing her about the benefits of trade liberalisation, Sheikh Hasina quipped, “you don’t have to convince me about trade liberalisation. When I was living with my physicist husband in the Italian city of Trieste on the Yugoslavian border, I watched the border being opened three times a week and people travelling across from both sides, purchasing goods and return.” This demonstrates that Sheikh Hasina was assiduously focused on economics rather than other considerations that politicians are attracted to. \n\nEven though between 1971 to 2009, Bangladesh had hiccups in accountability campaigns and military rule, since 2009, the army has taken the back seat. Bangladesh has seen less frequent derailment of civilian governments and experienced little legitimisation and delegitimization of governments. Although its democratic history is not untainted, Bangladesh’s government has largely avoided public criticism about corruption and inefficiency. Despite having little experience in governance, the Prime Minister possessed visionary acuity and conviction that economic progress was the only way to alleviate poverty in the country. \n\nAlthough marred by allegations of coercion of opponents, after over fifteen years of sustained growth, Bangladesh has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Back in 1970, the country was 75% poorer compared to Pakistan but now it is 45% richer. In 1970, it had 10 million more mouths to feed but now its population is 170 million compared to Pakistan’s 230 million. In 2021, Bangladesh’s exports were $47 billion while Pakistan’s exports were $28 billion. The income per capita in Bangladesh is $2,227 compared to Pakistan’s $1,543. In 2022, its gross domestic product (GDP) is $411 billion compared to the $347 billion in Pakistan. The annual inflation rate is 6% compared to Pakistan’s previous 12-15%, which has now risen to 21% and is expected to further increase. Also, the Bangladeshi taka is much stronger compared to the Pakistani rupee. Importantly, Bangladesh has a strong literacy rate with high female participation in the economy.\n\nIn Pakistan, political parties have remained interested in personal gains. The repeated manipulation of the democratic process has stymied the growth of strong, democratic, and non-dynastic parties. It is worth recognising that economic growth is closely tied with political stability, rule of law, strong civilian institutions, and participatory democracy. Pakistan inherited an overdeveloped state with a feeble bourgeoise linked in a patron-client relationship with a powerful state. The country has inevitably witnessed an economic and political evolution marked by privilege and patronage. Agriculture and business incomes are primarily excluded from the tax net. There is an absence of progressive wealth tax and huge industrial and estate complexes are exempt from any levies. Our parliament is dominated by landlords, it is a small wonder that agriculture income tax has been relegated as an inconsequential subject to the provincial domain. Consequently, the tax net remains small as agriculture and industrial sectors are undertaxed.\n\nSince 1958, all experiments with the government have augmented feudal power instead of empowering the masses. The growth path pursued in Pakistan has been skewed in favour of the privileged, rich, and elite who must now make their fair contribution to the state. \n\nFollowing Bangladesh’s example, Pakistani leadership must pursue economic growth as the national agenda and adopt constitutionalism along with regional peace. Without compromising viable defence, adequate resources must be released for social and economic development. Considering that regional avenues of growth necessitate trade liberalisation, foreign trade agreements must be formed with India, Iran, China, Afghanistan, and other trading partners. Also, the export-led growth model should refocus on high-value-added goods.\n\nPakistan enjoys a comparative advantage in cheaper labour, which must be transformed to improve skills and productivity. Education and technical training for women must be promoted and adopted widely to increase women’s participation in the workforce. Also, a safe and legally conducive environment is crucial for foreign investments. \n\nA serious effort is required to levy a fair tax on agricultural incomes and the rich industrial cartels must make their due contribution to national wealth. Besides wealth and death taxes, large corporate and estate sectors need to be brought into the tax net.\n\nPakistan’s leadership can learn many lessons from Bangladesh’s experience, but the main takeaway should be that Sheikh Hasina prioritised economic growth, which is crucial for both defence and democracy.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 2nd, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Sahibzada-Riaz-Noor1655837455-1/Sahibzada-Riaz-Noor1655837455-1.jpg"}, {"headline": "A stitch in time", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368349/a-stitch-in-time", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Jul 22 19:56:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhen Imran Khan first came to power, he repeatedly lamented the insufficient political space to pursue his promised agenda. PTI was new to governance and struggled to find direction. This found comparisons with other governance models mostly bordering on unchecked power and singular control. The closest we come to it in a democracy is the presidential form but it sits against the ethos of a parliamentary governance model — more popularly accepted given our peculiar political environment. Legislation and parliamentary support for substantial reform stood unattended and PTI’s agenda remained undelivered. That was the moment to return to the electorate for a new mandate through a snap, mid-term or early election. He dithered and stalled till the chips fell. And then it was too late.\n\nToday the nation and the state is at a cross-road and most paths lead out to further disaster than seen in the last six months. It may be politics to those engaged in it but it spells life and death for a nation. There hasn’t been a more precarious moment in our national history. Politics, so used to arbitration, isn’t finding one at the moment — so controversial have the traditional points of mediation turned. The army and its leadership was maligned at will for the most part of the last six years. Any insinuation of the army’s leadership amounts to deliberate subversion, sedition and disruption in the military order. It is now a daily fodder. That the military politicised itself so much as to be a fair game is something for it to ponder over and deal with; but in a country where institutions have had to lend a hand in governance, their need to arbitrate when politicians feud will never go away. With such malicious and vicious attacks on it, the military has been literally neutralised.\n\nMaking courts controversial is the next ploy. The focus is on subverting the judiciary in public non-cooperation to contrive decisions of a side’s liking. A political system’s inability to resolve its own predicaments means that courts are asked to arbitrate. They are then framed for activism and judicial coups in public narrative when decisions don’t go their way. This is patent blackmail. In an environment where the economy is on the verge of crashing, if not already crashed, the threat of a default looms, 120 million people of Punjab have been without a functioning government for the last four months at the hands of political shenanigan-ism, the military is fighting a rear-guard action against terrorism in its midst, and the international environment is tenuous, fragile and laden against us politically and economically, governance is a non-functioning entity while politics is at best fratricidal and predatory. Those responsible for each of these, fiddle instead in crass opportunistic entanglement. There isn’t an institution left that has not been tarnished. So complete is the insinuation and slander. The crisis meanwhile only deepens and engorges us from all sides.\n\nThere are four possible ways-out from the current predicament:\n\n1) There can be a reset of the entire thing as has been the traditional resort when the army intervened and installed a transitional government after it had stalled into inaction. It has always left serious negative consequences to politics and governance in the country and skewed the balance of power unfairly. In the army itself the effects are substantively adverse and distasteful to its own professional culture. It is best avoided.\n\n2) The courts may declare a state of mis-governance in the country and an absence of a government that strictly conforms to the legal, constitutional and moral mandate to claim power. It may then emplace a national government composed of both political and non-political technocrats to fill-in for a period of 6 months to a year to reform and reset what has become broken in the normal course of things resulting in political stagnation. Historically, political classes have manipulated constitutional and legal statutes in their favour. Politics has also tended to corrupt the judicial system through inducement or fear of retribution or manipulation through parliamentary power to proverbially cut the wings of what is perceived a largely independent judiciary — a sine qua non in a democratic state. This option may seem appealing given our state of disorder and institutional break-down, though political parties for the most part will play spoilers to this arrangement by disassociating and disowning the reform process. Arbitrating structures must find a way to engage with political structures to make them a willing part of the process. A constitutional protection will be needed to safeguard any statutory recourse for making governance more sustainable and consistent.\n\n3) The third option is the Sri Lankan way. When the control of the government and its capacity to govern melted away, the only remaining power was that of the people on the streets. Law enforcement agencies could only do so much in the initial stages of the uprising but as soon as it got bigger and voluminous, law enforcement drew back to avoid bloodshed against its own citizens. The option engenders anarchy and chaos, and fragments a nation’s and a society’s core ethos as well as its physical and structural pillars. A nation may then dissolve and a state may cease to exist. In a nuclear-capable nation, it remains unthinkable and will invite intervention, even external. Although Imran Khan has waved this bogey often in a hope to elicit institutional support in favour of his political objectives, it remains a red-flag event needing constant monitoring. Khan has been very poorly and insidiously advised to use this option as a ploy. We have enough political and moral acumen in the country to save us from such a disastrous consequence.\n\n4) Our polity, so used to external arbitration, perhaps needs it the most in current times. It stands dysfunctional and polarised to the point of rupture. Seemingly there exists little possibility for political players to come together in consensus on critical issues. Such is the intensity and depth of the divide. Yet it remains the only saviour out of our debilitating predicament. The President, the army, and the judiciary will need to come together at this precarious moment beyond their respective constitutional domains to avoid a multi-sectoral meltdown of the state and the nation. The agreed mechanism in the 1973 constitution continues to be either subverted or manipulated for political favour, forcing resort to the judiciary for adjudication. Necessary tweaking of laws and statutes may be needed in a consensus to enable sustainable, resilient, transparent and effective governance both at the center and in the provinces. Early elections and a new mandate are essential for a credible government to carry an effective voice with multilateral and bilateral partners.\n\nA half derelict non-concern for a free-falling economy by the government seems more a ploy to keep the powers-that-be interested in rushing the props to keep the government in place. Such purposed neglect is insidious and needs immediate redressal. We cannot sit idly by as negative politics unravels the order. A stitch in time will save us some more.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 29th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Shahzad-Chaudhry1592677757-0/Shahzad-Chaudhry1592677757-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan pulls out of India chess event", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368293/pakistan-pulls-out-of-india-chess-event", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Jul 22 06:50:07 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan have withdrawn from the world's biggest international chess tournament in protest at hosts India holding a torch relay for the event through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Thursday.\n\nThe 44th Chess Olympiad will see over 1,700 players from 188 nations compete in Chennai from now until August 10.\n\nThe last two competitions were played virtually because of the pandemic.\n\nThe Kashmir dispute has weathered decades of violence and upheaval since it was partitioned between India and Pakistan when both countries became independent in 1947.\n\nThe neighbours both claim it in full and have fought two of their three wars over control of the territory.\n\n\"By passing the torch relay through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir...

And yet, the military-industrial complex continues to thrive, elite capture remains elusive, and the juggernaut of divisive politics continues to cause fissures in our cultural zeitgeist. A colossal amount of black money — Pakistan’s illegitimate parallel economy — remains unseen, unreported and untaxed. Whether we are a police officer or a judge, a petty officer or a general, a building contractor or a factory owner, we continue to lie, cheat and defraud others and our country on our way to achieving our goals. Our economy and our morality both are on the cusp of default. As a society, we cannot stoop lower.\n\nIf there is one trait that defines political leadership like none other, it is narcissism. In our frenzied political landscape, knocking at the door of the Supreme Court has become an obsessive-compulsive ritual. If our politicians don’t get what they want, they are quick to approach the highest bench. Regardless of which party they belong to, if the judges rule in their favour, they are hailed as honest and impartial; if the judgements go against them, the same judges are deemed as partial and biased.\n\nOn July 22, a letter was waved once again, this time in the chamber of the Punjab Assembly. This time, it was the Hamza-Elahi face-off. We were back to watching television news shows where uncouth tirades were interrupted by even more uncouth tirades hurled by so-called political pundits. But here is the gist of the problem: legal discussions on the constitutionality of a matter are enlightening, they’re a thing of beauty; but when polluted by partisanship, these same discussions lose their intellectual value.\n\nWhy are politicians so obsessed with hanging on to power? The answer lies in the question itself: power. And this brings me to the power paradox which simply means that we act with empathy and modesty at first but quickly turn to coercion, manipulation and exploitation as soon as we acquire power. Whether we are corporate executives or CEOs, monarchs or political leaders, or even patriarchs in a patriarchal society, the power paradox applies to all of us. Inherent within us is a proclivity for pathological addiction to power, vanity and self-importance.\n\nIs greed a precursor to the power paradox? Is greed the driving force for success? Gordon Grekko, a character played by Michael Douglas in the movie Wall Street, puts it bluntly when he says, “the point is ladies and gentlemen that greed is, for lack of a better word, good.” The fact remains that we are rats in a rat race. Greed feeds our egos. Greed also divides us between the haves and the have-nots, between the exploiters and the exploited. Karl Marx was prophetic about our fate under capitalism: “Money is the universal, self-constituted value of all things. It has therefore robbed the whole world, human as well as natural, of its own values.”\n\nOut of hope or despair, we follow political leaders only to be ushered to the innermost circle of hell. On the one hand, we have political clans that remind us of the Sicilian mafia, the Cosa Nostra. On the other hand, we have a self-aggrandising braggart who shares a passing resemblance with Mussolini. We gather in thousands and listen to them deliver inspiring speeches just like Hitler did about a hundred years ago or Donald Trump more recently. They promise to save our country, to restore our lost glory, our greatness and excellence, while they make secret deals behind closed doors in the dead of the night.\n\nIn Botan Doro, a chilling ghost story, a handsome Japanese samurai falls in love with a beautiful girl carrying a lantern who visits his town every night but disappears before dawn. Smitten with her charm, he chases her down. They begin to spend the nights together. One early morning, the samurai’s nosy neighbour sneaks into his house and finds him dead in his room with his body locked in a tight embrace with a skeleton. The woman was nothing more than a ghost, a seductress.\n\nI wonder if we are all chasing a ghost.\n\n \n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 28th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Dr-Baqar-Hasnain1649437948-0/Dr-Baqar-Hasnain1649437948-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Sanity should prevail", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2367958/sanity-should-prevail", "date_published": "Tue, 26 Jul 22 19:41:28 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe conducts of our political leaders, betraying lack of sense of responsibility and going at any length to stay in power, provide a living example of why nations fail. Not that Pakistan has a history of clean politics but the present crisis especially in Punjab is extremely serious and is taking place when global and regional conditions are pitched against us.\n\nMore consequential is the fact that the country’s economy is in dire straits and the government is desperately seeking IMF and friendly countries to bail it out. Instead of focusing on the best use of scarce resources to satisfy the needs of the people, mismanagement is making matters worse. History seems to be repeating itself as both PTI and the PML-N-led coalition are seeking the support of the army leadership and putting pressure on the judiciary to tilt verdicts in their favour. Whatever tactics the government may employ to stay in power in Punjab and at the Center will only add to the misery of the silent majority, and strengthen the army’s leverage.\n\nImran Khan’s deliberate policy of ignoring democratic institutions and shunning the opposition defies the basic concept of pluralism and tends toward dictatorial instincts. When the entire political energy is geared towards demolishing the opponent instead of presenting oneself as a better candidate or party through performance, the political scenario can turn ugly very quickly. And this situation we are already witnessing. Besides, the prevalent policy of all political parties of blocking programs and initiatives that the previous government had initiated irrespective of country needs has to cease. By such inimical responses the worst affected are the ordinary people. It is unfortunate that the ruling party and the opposition are weakening the political structure and pursuing policies that undermine the economy and lower the image of the country. Moreover, such elite and party polarisation has filtered down at the grass-root level.\n\nIn all the main political parties — PML-N, PTI and PPP — there is excessive concentration of power in the top leadership that is preventing the advantage of making and implementing better policies that would have emerged otherwise from valuable input from the higher tier leadership where sufficient talent and experience resides. Unless political parties do not internally democratise, there is scant hope of improving the quality of democracy at the national, provincial and local levels. Moreover, when political parties have a mix of conservative and liberal, educated and experienced in sufficient numbers, politics of compromise and a certain level of decorum prevails. That seems a long way off and our present challenge is how to reduce the animosity and bitter rivalry among political parties. The flow of dirty money to influence political behaviour has become common place and politicians, instead of enacting laws and taking disciplinary action against the violators, are frequently promoting it. Checks and balances are already in our system but these are largely ignored. We have to work towards the goal to revive these, but to expect that our politicians in their present state of mind would be thinking along these lines would be day-dreaming. Can we also afford to give up and let the country continue to slide?\n\nAdding to our national woes is the adverse international environment. The Russia-US confrontation over Ukraine requires deft handling of foreign relations and the economy in which a better understanding and cooperation of major political parties is necessary. Due to accelerating global inflation and scarcity of basic essentials, especially of fuel, agricultural and industrial products, not only are the prices rapidly increasing but they are frequently becoming scarce. Unfortunately, there is hardly any realisation of these developments that is reflected in the political behaviour.\n\nThe US-China rivalry has also stepped up as President Biden has taken an aggressive posture toward China to dampen its fast-growing economy and influence in the coming years. Apart from its overall negative global fallout, it creates not only economic but also strategic restraints on Pakistan. It would remain a challenge for Pakistan diplomacy to steer this hostile terrain. While remaining steadfast in maintaining a strategic relationship with China, Pakistan should seek close relations with the US in terms of economy and trade. But, here too there is no serious thought being given apart from leaving it to our diplomats. Fortunately, we have highly professional and dedicated diplomats, and presently a competent Foreign Minister that is managing foreign policy astutely under trying conditions. What cannot be overlooked is that Pakistan’s foreign policy would carry weight when Pakistan is internally stable and its economy is strong.\n\nWhat is worrisome is that in this anarchic domestic situation, education, infrastructure, healthcare, and research and development are being ignored with serious consequences for the country’s future. The IT revolution and expansion of globalisation has been only partially absorbed. Leaders struggling for political survival are thinking and planning largely on a short horizon and neglecting these areas. This also has to do with the quality of the power structure and priorities that are driven by special or personal interests. Similarly, how many politicians are listening to the lone voice and warnings of Sherry Rehman on climate change and global warming. Or that of Raza Rabbani, Aitzaz Ahsan on wise political and constitutional issues. Successive government leaderships have been unwilling to open their minds to issues that are long-term, despite the reality that climate change is occurring right here largely due to human activities. There is an urgent need to give serious thought on how to respond to it and should invite interest across the political spectrum.\n\nBut despite the highly disturbing political and economic situation we are experiencing, it can all change provided some sanity among top political leadership prevails. Imran Khan has to lower his rhetoric, take serious issues to parliament and refrain from shaking the frail political structure. And the PDM coalition leadership should avoid political vendetta, take effective measures toward improving governance and lifting the economy while the clock is still ticking.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 27th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1083504-TalatMasoodNew-1460481455/1083504-TalatMasoodNew-1460481455.JPG"}, {"headline": "PM Shehbaz's son in the soup for 'incitement to violence' on Twitter", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2365432/pm-shehbazs-son-in-the-soup-for-incitement-to-violence-on-twitter", "date_published": "Sat, 09 Jul 22 11:12:07 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfter a Twitter account purportedly belonging to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's oldest son --- Suleman Sharif, urged his followers to \"toss shoes\" and \"name and shame\" a family that heckled Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal in a viral video on Friday, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf supporters heavily trolled the businessman's post and called for the account to be blocked for trying to incite violence.\n\n\n\nمیرے شیرو جہاں اس فیملی کو دیکھو۔ جوتے مارو۔ اس گنڈا گرد اور گنڈا لیڈر @ImranKhanPTI اور چورنی پیرنی نظر آئے 🦯 تیار رکھو۔ https://t.co/2srX5PMXJ9\n— Zi Suleman Sharif (@zi_suleman) July 8, 2022\n\n\nIqbal was targeted by PTI supporters as he stood in a queue waiting to place his order in a fast food joint at Bhera Interchange near Punjab's Sargodha.

In this regard, health officials in Rawalpindi were baffled to detect large number of dengue mosquito larvae at 16,000 different locations — 15,601 houses and 1,000 other localities — during indoor and outdoor surveillance campaigns. This is indeed an alarming revelation which could lead to a deadly outbreak in the near future.\n\nIt is believed that these dengue larvae have been breeding on a large scale during the ongoing monsoon season that saw many places inundated with water. Where there is stagnant water, dengue mosquitoes are bound to increase in number and become a health threat. The district has been carrying out anti-dengue campaigns but unfortunately implementation has been lacking as 99 locations were left out and fake activities were recorded in 377 locations. Officials have taken timely action by registering FIRs, sealing buildings, issuing challans and enforcing dengue SOPs but a systematic action plan must be carried out to destroy breeding grounds before these larvae mature. The ordeal also indicates the importance of draining rainwater in a timely manner. But with many provinces across Pakistan witnessing unprecedented levels of rain, dengue could very well escalate into a national health crisis. This merits attention from the very top.\n\nSurveillance campaigns must be carried out across flood affected areas to identify and destroy breeding grounds. Urban cities must issue dengue SOPs and work towards draining the remaining water left in affected localities. Abandoned buildings along with ponds, pools and other bodies of water in recreational spaces must not be left unchecked. But most importantly, the healthcare sector must be notified and well-equipped to deal with any outbreak.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 19th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "tabiyat.pk joins forces with Hayat Kimya to add quality mother and baby products to its portfolio", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2371800/tabiyatpk-joins-forces-with-hayat-kimya-to-add-quality-mother-and-baby-products-to-its-portfolio", "date_published": "Thu, 18 Aug 22 07:22:34 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\t \n\nIt has been announced that MEDZnMORE's tabiyat.pk has signed an agreement with Hayat Kimya, the fifth largest diaper manufacturer in Pakistan.

The rainy season makes a large number of people susceptible to eye infections as the moisture content in the air creates a favourable condition for bacteria, viruses and other germs to grow and multiply.\n\nAs monsoon rains continue unabated, a large number of people including women and children suffering from eye infections, allergies and conjunctivitis have started making a beeline for hospitals in Garrison City.\n\nOphthalmologists say that allergies and eye infections are a common occurrence during these rainy days as, according to them, the air gets filled with bacteria and viruses. Doctors have advised citizens to take precautions to avoid catching the disease during the current weather conditions.\n\nAccording to Ophthalmologist Dr Tahir Farooq, conjunctivitis is an eye infection that spreads rapidly from one person to another. “Generally, this infection gains momentum in the summer or rainy season. During moist weather conditions, conjunctivitis spreads very rapidly but it can be prevented by taking preventive measures,” he said.\n\nHe said that people must frequently wash hands and avoid hand-to-eye contact to keep eye infections at bay. \n\nThe doctor said that people should avoid rubbing their eyes with fingers as they contain germs and can lead to an infection. He said that people should not share towels, napkins etc as doing so can raise the risk of suffering from eye infections.\n\nNaveed Shams, a patient suffering from conjunctivitis, said that seven out of 11 persons in his house have fallen prey to conjunctivitis.\n\nPatients suffering from the disease feel severe irritation in their eyes and it becomes very difficult to open their eyes in the sunlight. “The patient's eyes become red and water starts discharging from the eyes. I have been visiting the doctor for the last three days, but I did not get any sort of relief,” he said adding that he was following the precautionary measures said by the doctor so that other members of his household would not catch the disease.\n\nAccording to the data obtained from three allied hospitals in Rawalpindi, the number of patients with conjunctivitis has increased in the rainy season as compared to normal days\n\nAs per statistics released by the three allied hospitals, 12 more patients suffering from conjunctivitis have landed in hospitals in the last 24 hours.\n\nEye disease expert Dr Mudassar said that conjunctivitis can also be caused by dust rising after the rain. He said that polluted air and excessive use of fast lighting devices were also the cause of this disease. \n\nHe said that citizens have to show responsibility to prevent the spread of conjunctivitis. He said that the water discharged from the patient's eyes is toxic and when a patient cleans it with his hands, it becomes infected and the disease could be transmitted to other people through shaking hands.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 18th, 2022.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1732991-eyesurgery_reuters-1528782738/1732991-eyesurgery_reuters-1528782738.jpg"}, {"headline": "Two cops killed in attack on polio team in Tank", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2371443/two-cops-killed-in-attack-on-polio-team-in-tank", "date_published": "Tue, 16 Aug 22 08:29:27 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tTwo policemen were killed in an attack on a polio team by armed men on Tuesday in the Tank district of ​​Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).\n\nAccording to the police, constables Pir Rehman and Nisar died in the shooting and their bodies have been shifted to the hospital.

Potential investors Unity has been speaking to have made big bets on the metaverse, they said.\n\nWith China tightening data handling regulations, Unity believes a spin-off would aid this expansion as it would give the unit more local ownership and autonomy over how it operates in the country, which could also increase its attraction to local government and state-owned partners, the people said.\n\nThe spin-off would be one of China's bigger technology deals this year as investment activity has slowed due to weak economic growth, COVID-19 outbreaks and regulatory tightening.\n\nUnity China Chief Executive Zhang Junbo has been working on the plan for at least a year, two of the people said.

Cyber-terrorists and state-sponsored hackers are the key actors in cyber-war, who not only attack websites to deface them and steal Facebook accounts, but also compromise and destroy our country's economic security.\n\nA malware agent used in a cyberattack for military, paramilitary, or intelligence purposes is usually referred to as a cyberweapon. Data theft and electronic or physical destruction are examples of cyber weapons. While a cyberweapon nearly always causes direct or indirect financial harm to the target organization, direct financial gain for the sponsor is not the primary goal of this type of agent.\n\nA cyber-army is a group of troops with advanced cyber talents who are extremely competent in information technology. Countries should use cyber-armies to maintain national cybersecurity. China is ranked first in cyber defensive power, followed by the Netherlands and France, then the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the United States leads in cyber offensive, cyber norms influence, and cyber intelligence. Teams at Cyber Command are allocated to specific adversaries — including Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China — and have worked with the intelligence community for years to get access to digital networks. Cyberweapons are stealth weapons that, like any computer code, are written in zeros and ones. They have the ability to infiltrate entire networks as well as infect individual PCs. They have the ability to block communication systems, confound enemy signals, and stop military attacks before they happen, all without the flash and bang of traditional weapons of war.\n\nAlthough cyber warfare is a new phenomenon in its current form, the notion is as old as warfare itself. Rivals used to try to physically interrupt their opponent's communication networks in the old days as well. Similarly, using all available means, well-thought-out strategies were used to gain access to information systems and develop mechanisms of misinformation in enemy ranks.\n\nHumans are becoming increasingly reliant on technology due to rapid advancements in communication tool applications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the efficacy of these technical techniques was put to the test. Even the most advanced states with cutting-edge medical facilities were crippled for months, forcing everyone from executives to administrative staff to work digitally from their homes.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of cyber threats has muddled the internal and external dimensions of national security, allowing less powerful state and non-state actors to increase their influence efforts. One of the causes that have fostered the formation of hybrid threats or made irregular warfare more appealing is the shifting nature of traditional ideas of armed conflict and war, because these may not motivate military action.\n\nDue to its great capacity to disrupt communication infrastructure, cyberwarfare is now regarded as a more appropriate tactic for offensive action against a rival. This is particularly risky because it has the potential to immobilize the target system for the duration of the disruption. Highly sensitive defense installations, such as command and control systems, missile-firing sites, air defense systems, and, more importantly, strategic decision-making mechanisms, may be included in these systems.\n\nThe race for space dominance, which began in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik-I by the then-Soviet Union and ended in 1958 with the launch of the United States' first manned space voyage, was perhaps to attain improved connectedness, integration, and networking in the decades to come. However, knowledge gained via advancements in the fields of information and space technology is now being used in a bad way to disrupt the same communication and integration.\n\nState institutions have become increasingly vulnerable as a result of the use of cyber warfare as part of a strategy to disrupt enemy lines of communication and cause harm to their prospective capabilities. Personal security, which is an important component of human security, is also vulnerable to disruptions in communication, location, and financial activities, to name a few examples. As a result, international and national organizations must establish legal procedures to ensure that cyber warfare does not violate an individual's rights or deprive him or her of his or her financial assets. \n\nCyber-warfare tools used by the military could eventually fall into the hands of hackers. According to Interpol Secretary General Jurgen Stock, in a few years, state-developed cyberweapons will be available on the darknet, a hidden area of the internet that cannot be accessed using search engines like Google.\n\n\"In the physical world, that is a significant problem—we have weapons that are used on the battlefield today and will be utilized by organized crime groups tomorrow. The same is true for digital weapons that are currently in use by the military, have been created by the military, and will be available to criminals tomorrow.\"\n\nRansomware, in which hackers lock down a company's computer systems and demand a ransom payment to regain control, is one of the most common cyberweapons. Cyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nCyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Moscow has been blamed for a number of cyberattacks that occurred before and during its military invasion of Ukraine, but it has always denied the allegations. Meanwhile, Ukraine has solicited the assistance of volunteer hackers from all around the world to aid in its defense against Russian aggression. A \"significant number\" of cyberattacks go unnoticed. \"It's not just law enforcement that demands we develop bridges between our silos, the islands of information,\" says the author. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Cybersecurity Outlook study, the number of cyberattacks worldwide more than doubled in 2021. According to the research, ransomware remains the most common sort of assault, with firms being targeted 270 times each year on average. Critical energy infrastructure and supply lines are being jeopardized by cyberattacks. \n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/top-view-unrecognizable-hacker-performing-cyberatt1659791000-0/top-view-unrecognizable-hacker-performing-cyberatt1659791000-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Future Fest founder Arzish Azam represents Pakistan at BSV Global Blockchain Convention in Dubai", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2359364/future-fest-founder-arzish-azam-represents-pakistan-at-bsv-global-blockchain-convention-in-dubai", "date_published": "Tue, 31 May 22 15:40:56 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfter the success of Future Fest 2022 on May 13-15 in Islamaba, Arzish Azam was invited to represent Pakistan as a speaker at BSV Global Blockchain Convention at Grand Hyatt Dubai held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Saud bin Saqr al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council – Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah.\n\nFuture Fest is the largest tech conference of expo of Pakistan, attended by big web3 companies such as Binance, Epic Games, Kucoin, BitOasis and BSV.

Since the enabling expression of “may be released on bail” is used in this part, read with the basic principles of criminal justice, the grant of bail in a non-bailable offence that does not fall within the second part of Section 497(1) CrPC is said to be a rule and refusal an exception.\n\n\"The second part of Section 497(1) CrPC provides that an accused shall not be released on bail if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for ten years. This part of Section 497(1) CrPC which prohibits the grant of bail in certain offences is popularly known as the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\"\n\nHowever, the order said that the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC provides that the court may direct that any person under the age of sixteen years or any woman or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be released on bail.\n\nThe expression “such an offence” used in this proviso refers to the offence mentioned in the second part (prohibitory clause) of Section 497(1) CrPC, as for all other non-bailable offences the court is already empowered to release the accused on bail under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nThe first proviso has thus made equal the power of the court to grant bail in the offences of prohibitory clause alleged against an accused under the age of sixteen years, a woman accused and a sick or infirm accused, to its power under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\n\"This means that in cases of women, etc., as mentioned in the first proviso to Section 497(1), irrespective of the category of the offence, bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as an exception in the same manner as it is granted or refused in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nExceptions\n\nThe apex court also noted that the exceptions for refusing bail in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC are therefore also applicable to the accused who pray for bail under the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC in an offence falling within the prohibitory clause.\n\n“These exceptions are well settled by several judgements of this court. They are the likelihood of the accused: (a) to abscond to escape trial; (b) to tamper with the prosecution evidence or influence the prosecution witnesses to obstruct the course of justice; or (c) to repeat the offence keeping in view his previous criminal record, nature of the offence or the desperate manner in which he has prima facie acted in the commission of the offence.\"\n\nRegarding the case in hand, the bench noted that they do not find any material that would attract any of the above exceptions in order to refuse bail to the present petitioner.\n\n\"We are cognizant of the fact that the persons involved in the commission of offences of robbery or dacoity are usually professional criminals and there is a likelihood that they would repeat the offence if enlarged on bail. But the case of the present petitioner is distinguishable as she was working as a maid in the house of the complainant as per his own version, therefore, she does not appear to be a professional robber or dacoit and we do not find a likelihood of her repeating the offence if released on bail.\"\n\n\"The impugned order passed by the high court is, thus, not sustainable under the law and calls for interference by this Court.

Likewise, when the FIR is registered then the court should also initiate a contempt proceedings or not.\n\nThe Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday decided to initiate contempt proceedings against Imran Khan for passing controversial remarks regarding female sessions court judge Zeba Chaudhry.\n\nAt a rally in Islamabad’s F-9 park on Saturday, Imran had threatened to file cases against Islamabad’s inspector general (IG) of police and deputy inspector general (DIG) of police and declared: “We won’t spare you.” He then warned the judiciary against its “biased” attitude towards his party, saying that it should brace itself for the consequences.\n\nThis is not the first time the court is taking up a contempt matter against Imran. However, the PTI chief has managed to secure relief in such cases.\n\nIn 2013, the top court had summoned cricketer-turned-politician Imran for a contempt hearing over his \"critical and derogatory\" remarks against the judiciary.\n\nImran, who had by then made a major breakthrough in the general election, had allegedly said that the polls were rigged and criticised the judiciary and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not taking notice.\n\n\"While holding press conference on 26.7.2013, he (Khan) stated that the role of judiciary and Election Commission of Pakistan is shameful in the conduct of general elections; that the elections were rigged, due to role played by these two institutions,\" the apex court’s notice read.\n\nHowever, in a major relief for Imran, the Supreme Court decided to drop contempt proceedings on the suggestion of the then attorney general for Pakistan Muneer A Malik.\n\nA three-member bench headed by Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali discharged the notice after hearing the arguments of AGP Munir in the case who said that it is not the matter of disobedience.\n\nThe judgment said that admittedly, Imran Khan is a public figure and duly elected member of the National Assembly who has not only been actively involved in politics for a considerable period, but also heads a political party.\n\n\"In such circumstances, while considering his conduct, we also cannot lose sight of the provision of Articles-19 and 66 of our Constitution, relating to freedom of speech and the privileges of members of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament).”\n\n\"Thus, at this juncture, as a note of caution, we may observe that politicians and other public figures having their say and a following amongst the public are expected to use more decent and guarded language and have to be more careful in the selection of words in public gatherings or press conferences so as to show their intellect, maturity of mind and wisdom qua respect to various national institutions, and to present themselves as role models for the society at large,” the judgement noted.\n\nSimilarly, earlier this year, the Supreme Court refused to initiate contempt proceedings against the PTI chief over the non-implementation of its May 25 order.\n\nThe apex court had issued clear instructions to hold its Azadi March protest near Peshawar Mor between the H-9 and G-9 areas of Islamabad. However, Imran and his protestors did make their way toward D-Chowk, prompting the government to call in the Pakistan Army for the security of the capital's Red Zone.\n\nThe apex court had formed a five-member larger bench, headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, to hear the application filed by Attorney General of Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf.\n\nHowever, SC Judge Justice Yahya Afridi, while dissenting with the majority order, observed that a contempt proceeding should be initiated against PTI chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan for instructing party activists and supporters to proceed toward D-Chowk in violation of the SC's May 25 order.\n\nHe noted that there was sufficient material before the SC to initiate a contempt proceeding against Imran Khan over violation of the May 25 order and instructed the party activists and supporters to proceed toward D-Chowk.\n\nHowever, instead of issuing a contempt notice, the majority judges on June 1 sought reports from director generals of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) as well as Islamabad IG police, interior secretary and others over the alleged involvement of PTI leaders in instigating party workers to reach Islamabad's D-Chowk in violation of its May 25 order.\n\nLater the court was apprised by the law enforcement agencies that a “crowd was organised to enter Red Zone under the PTI leadership who had reached Express Chowk with the intent to proceed further towards D-Chowk as per the directions of the party’s highest command”.\n\nThe matter is still pending in the apex court.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/court-hammer1658069967-0/court-hammer1658069967-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Administrative issues jack up NHA project costs", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372681/administrative-issues-jack-up-nha-project-costs", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:15:58 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe cost of 33 National Highway Authority (NHA) projects has increased from Rs79.5 billion in 2008 to Rs90.73 billion in 2021 due to non-availability of funds and delay in land acquisition.\n\nAccording to the documents available with The Express Tribune, between 2008 and 2021, 33 projects of the authority were completed at cost overruns.

My enthusiasm was further bolstered by the welcome board en route to Makkah which stated “Guests of Ar-Rahman, your safety is our responsibility”.\n\n\n\nOn July 7th, I joined the one million pilgrims – 1.5 million less than in 2019 – in Minna. This was the largest Hajj gathering since the pandemic had forced numbers to 10,000 Muslims in 2020 and 60,000 Muslims in 2021. Suffice to say, all eyes were on the Kingdom. This year’s Hajj also coincided with 100 years of Saudi Arabia’s organising of the annual pilgrimage. Hajj 1443 was made all the more special since it coincided with a Friday, making it Hajj-e-Akbar.\n\n\n\nCompared to my previous experience, the zeal among the pilgrims seemed somewhat diminished. At first, I believed these to be misapprehensions given the reduced numbers. However, increased interaction with my companions made me realise that the pandemic, circumventing all biases, had been hard on everyone regardless of stature. Without a doubt, Covid-19 has broken each and every one of us in some way. The white barrier between the Kabbah and pilgrims was a reinforcing testament to the ‘new normal’ we have all been forced to adopt.\n\n\n\nFrom my past encounters, I was on the lookout for miracles. And I was not disappointed. A friend had related that the people of Makkah claim that clouds provide shade to the Hujjaj. I witnessed this first hand on the Day of Arafat – considered the apex of Hajj – during which unexpected clouds started forming in a previously clear sky, thereby making it tolerable to sit outside in the 44-degree heat. The same happened during the rest of the pilgrimage days. Each ritual reaffirmed what I had grown up hearing: “Hajj sabr ka naam hai” (Hajj is the name of patience), which further reinforces the South African phrase “Umuntu Ngumuntu Ngabantu” (I am because of what we all are). This feeling, I believe now, is a miracle in itself.\n\n\n\nIn line with their Vision 2030, this year, the Kingdom had undertaken many experiments and introduced many changes, with mixed results. A major issue was for those journeying from America, Europe and Australia who had to apply for Hajj using an online portal. There was a lack of clarity in the draw process and mix ups, as a result of which, many people were turned back from the airport.\n\nHowever, this is not to take away from the many improvements I witnessed. In keeping with their national rejuvenation plans, the Saudis had increased the application of modern technology by harnessing the best electronic devices available. This included the “In your languages, we welcome you” campaign, which aims at guiding the pilgrims in 23 languages. This highlighted increased inclusivity and accommodation of pilgrims which I had previously not witnessed.\n\n\n\nA robot introduced in the Grand Mosque, Makkah to distribute Qurans to worshipers.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable sights for me was to see Hajjis zooming along on electric scooters. As a trial service, the Saudi Public Authority for Transport provided pilgrims with this service to help ease the time taken between Holy sites. For instance, the usually one-hour walk between Arafat to Muzdalifah was reduced to just 15 minutes. This is in addition to the Saudi Hajj Ministry’s adoption of smart technologies to help assure comfort of the Hajjis.\n\n\n\nBy the same token, there were visibly increased numbers of security officials and scouts to aid the pilgrims not only during the rituals but also in and around the Holy Mosques. Another marked change was the greater role of the youth in all areas of pilgrim assistance; be it spraying water on the pilgrims to provide relief from the heat or medics and security personnel.\n\nSimilarly, even though on previous visits I had noticed the expanding role of women in workplaces in the country, this time around it was very distinct. Now there were uniformed women officers inside the Mosque, women volunteers at the airport and even women administering passenger data input. These tasks had previously been reserved for men alone.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, after a two year international hiatus, Hajj 1443 was a success and a triumph for the Muslim ummah in the face of the trials and tribulations brought on by the pandemic. Restored, refreshed and recentered, I departed Madina airport, leaving a part of my soul in Makkah and a piece of my heart in the Prophet’s (PBUH) city.\n\n\nAll photos courtesy of the author.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1081507-HajjTawafKaabaAFP-1460156940/1081507-HajjTawafKaabaAFP-1460156940.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan and Iran: The potential for a great alliance", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97602/pakistan-and-iran-the-potential-for-a-great-alliance", "date_published": "Wed, 22 Jun 22 08:36:24 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMarred by sectarian violence, opposing interests, differing foreign policies and failed economic possibilities, Pakistan-Iran relations have soured throughout the years. As a result, Islamabad has seldom explored the possibility of deeper relations with its western neighbour.\n\nAlthough Pakistan and Iran co-operate on a multitude of different platforms and sectors, the degree of cooperation has often been tested, and a considerable amount of blame for this falls on Pakistan’s shoulders. Shackled by its external constraints, primarily in the form of American influence, the risk of Saudi alienation, and the sanctions on Iran, Pakistan has consistently remained reluctant to pursue deeper relations. Iran, on the other hand, has shown a willingness to strengthen bilateral ties, the chief example being the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline. Islamabad’s lack of interest has not gone unnoticed in Tehran.\n\nIndignant about Pakistan’s ambivalent foreign policy, Iran has sought a closer relationship with India, which has proven to be a resourceful and trustworthy partner. In direct competition with Pakistan’s Gwadar port, Indian support helped Iran mobilise Chabahar as a major oceanic port in the region. Furthermore, Indian influence in Iran has helped India to indirectly meet its nefarious interests against Pakistan, particularly vis-a-vis Balochistan and Southern Afghanistan. As a result, Islamabad’s lack of interest in seeking a meaningful relationship with Iran has weakened its overall influence and created a region where Pakistan is becoming increasingly cornered.\n\nHowever, the obstacles which once sought to hinder Pak-Iran relations are now beginning to wither away, paving the way for a potentially great alliance.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Pakistan faces when it comes to Iran is pressure from its ally, the United States (US). America has been explicitly vocal against any form of cooperation between Iran and Pakistan, and it is no secret that it has sabotaged numerous initiatives between the two nations. However, following the war in Ukraine, America has had a change of heart. With the threat of a severe energy crisis inexorably hitting the developed and developing world, America has confronted the situation by re-engaging with countries that it once had vowed to eschew.\n\nIn March 2022, after years of estrangement, a senior American delegation had a rare face-to-face meeting with the Nicolas Maduro government in Caracas, Venezuela, the world’s most oil-rich country. The meeting had a one-point agenda: replace Russian oil with Venezuelan oil. Similar energy-focused engagements with Libya have also been undertaken by the US. More interestingly, the Biden administration has felt the JCPOA agreement (Iran Nuclear Deal) should be revived to relieve Iran of its sanctions and benefit from its abundant gas and oil supplies. Talks in Vienna are already underway and major headway is being made, highlighting the possibility that a deal could once again be struck.\n\nAmerica’s change in position is driven purely out of necessity for its own self-interest; however, with no end in sight in Ukraine, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US is adopting softer attitudes toward its oil-rich adversaries, in particular Iran. For Pakistan, this is a now or never opportunity: capitalise on the west’s relaxation now and secure deals with Iran or delay the opportunity and ultimately face the wrath of the west.\n\nAnother hurdle Pakistan faces when it comes to Iran is the Saudi Arabian question. Any venture with Iran risks the upsetting of ‘brotherly’ Saudi Arabia, and although Pakistan has remained explicitly neutral in the pair’s cold war – through the training, support, and cooperation with its armed forces – it is clear that Islamabad indirectly sides with Riyadh. As a result, Pakistan’s alliance with the Saudis bars it from exploring real terms with Iran.\n\nIn the past year, however, there have been growing signs of rapprochement between the two arch rivals. Through the meditation of Iraq and Oman, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been willing to sit at the peace table and are now engaging in their fifth round of direct talks. Furthermore, with the cessation of hostilities in Yemen as well as the re-opening of the Iranian representative office in the OIC, analysts are hopeful that the two countries are finally coming to some form of an agreement, and the possibility of re-establishing diplomatic missions is not too far fetched.\n\nAs for Pakistani gains in light of such developments, they are significant. Not only can Islamabad now engage peacefully with Tehran, without alienating Saudi Arabia, but it can also facilitate further reconciliation between the two countries and emerge as a key mediator of peace in the region.\n\nWith the roadblocks to cooperation finally lifting, Pakistan and Iran can pave the way for a great alliance. This alliance can take two forms, one of an economic dimension and the other of a non-economic one. However, the beauty of a Pak-Iran alliance is not in its business prospective nor the cultural linkages but in the fact that it is mutually beneficial. At home, both Iran and Pakistan face pressing issues of different kinds, yet both sides can help each other solve their respective problems.\n\nThe major cornerstone of Pak-Iran relations has been the proposed Pakistan-Iran (IP) gas pipeline, a proposition which can mutually benefit both sides simultaneously. Stretching from South Pars all the way to Punjab, the 1900km pipeline would provide inestimable value for both Pakistan and Iran. As it currently stands, however, the IP gas pipeline is an opportunity fading away. Despite the project’s inception nearly a decade ago, the pipeline has yet to even start. Iran’s side of the pipeline is built but has simply been left to rust, while Pakistan’s side is waiting to start construction.\n\nThe causes of Pakistan’s lack of initiative is due to the abovementioned external pressure coupled with internal distrust, leading to the project’s early abandonment. However, this can all change. As stated before, Iran’s rapidly changing geopolitical image, as well as the easing of Pakistani challenges vis-a-vis foreign policy could usher in a new wave of enthusiasm. The IP gas pipeline could finally restart and ultimately benefit the two countries immensely.\n\nPlagued with severe energy shortages, depleting indigenous sources and inchoate industries, Pakistan is on the brink of energy starvation. So far, loans and expensive imports have kept the energy sector afloat, but these are short-term solutions and are unsustainable in the long run. As for local energy sources within the country, they too have proven insufficient.\n\nUltimately, Pakistan will need to increase its imported energy, preferably at cheap and subsidised rates. Once revived, however, the IP gas pipeline can solve the majority of these problems. Providing 22 million cubic metres of gas a day, and electricity generation equivalent to nearly 4,500 megawatts, the pipeline would be able to meet nearly all of Pakistan’s current electricity shortfall. Furthermore, compared to its current import from countries such as Qatar, Iranian LNG is far more affordable.\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, the IP gas pipeline can cement Pak-Iran relations and effectively thwart expanding Indian influence in the region. What’s more interesting is that in 2016, China expressed the desire to invest in the pipeline and expand it into its own borders. Iran welcomed Chinese interest and sweetened the deal by expressing interest in joining the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). If Iran joins, an unparalleled trifecta in the region could emerge, hence promoting development, peace and stability. Although it is too early to tell right now, initial willingness from different countries has shown that the IP gas pipeline could be a catalyst for extraordinary cooperation in the region and beyond.\n\nFor Iran, the IP gas pipeline could provide much-needed relief to its ailing economy. Crippled by years of brutal sanctions, Iran has failed to effectively monetise its abundant oil and gas supplies, and as a result, has suffered from abysmally low GDP figures. Notably absent from LNG and oil markets, Iran is missing out and is eager to establish itself as a force in the economic world. Moreover, Iran has lacked an iron brother-like alliance with any of its neighbours to assist in alleviating its crises. For example, Iraq is embroiled in constant turmoil and lacks stability for any strong alliance to emerge, while neighbours in the Caucasus do not see eye-to-eye with Iran. However, an economic alliance with Pakistan is not only stable and safe, but the market of 220 million people can provide ample opportunity for Iran to fulfil its economic needs.\n\nOver the past decades, an environment of trepidation and apprehension has developed in place of a potentially fraternal relationship between Pakistan and Iran. The two countries have continually looked away from one another, opting to search thousands of miles away for rather unsustainable and short-lived alliances. However, as Pakistan and Iran unshackle themselves from the constraints of geopolitics, they must look towards one another for a better future.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/image1654671439-0/image1654671439-0.png"}, {"headline": "Does gun control even matter to GOP members and the NRA?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97595/does-gun-control-even-matter-to-gop-members-and-the-nra", "date_published": "Tue, 07 Jun 22 11:29:25 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMass shootings are gaining renewed momentum across the United States (US) in light of the Texas school shooting and Memorial Day gun violence in Chicago. The former incident is said to be the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook. These are just a few instances of gun violence that get plastered all over the news, and rightfully so.\n\nAccording to Gun Violence Archive, there have been at least 246 mass shootings in the US so far this year, far more than the number of days passed in 2022. More than 2,000 American teenagers between the ages 12 to 17 have been shot dead or injured this year. There have been 8,346 gun-related deaths, 15,768 injuries and 634 unintentional shootings. Moreover, 473 children between ages zero to 11 years were shot during the first half of this year. What also appears to be gripping parts of the US are imitation mass murders. Following the Memorial Day shootings, there have been 13 others this past weekend, leaving more than a dozen dead and at least 70 injured. Gun violence is an act of terrorism that is encouraging repressed individuals to come forward and commit crimes openly.\n\nIt is critical to consider the complexity of America’s gun violence epidemic. Although mass shooters target innocent civilians at large, people kill in self-defense; they also commit suicide using weapons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2020, 54% of all gun-related deaths in the US were suicides (24,292). Therefore, gun violence should never be equated to mass shootings alone. The issue is more nuanced than we think.\n\nTake for instance the Covid-19 pandemic. It caused 45,000 deaths (suicide or homicide) by guns. These deaths can be partly attributed to loss of jobs, psychological strain and exacerbated mental illness that Americans experienced in 2020.\n\nThat said, gun violence in America continues to take an emotional toll on families, while gun advocates observe in silence. Gun advocacy is a big part of the problem to push for safer, smarter gun control measures. A vocal proponent of guns is Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who signed seven laws, making it easier for people to access guns, including individuals over 21 who can carry a handgun without license and training. Easier access to guns caused gun violence to soar in Texas, which has one of the highest numbers of mass shootings in the US. Last year, Texas saw a 65% increase in mass shootings.\n\nOn top of gun advocates and GOP (republican party) members backing their second amendment rights, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has an equally important role to play in politicising gun control. It is no surprise that the NRA uses funds to push its agenda forward, which is to support guns left-right-centre. They use heaps of money to sway the debate surrounding gun control in their favour. Numerous Republicans⁠, Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, Mitch McConnell, and a dozen others have benefited from the NRA in the past, including a law firm that has backed the association for years in exchange of $23 million.\n\nIn the wake of deadly mass shootings, it is unfathomable that the NRA would hold its annual meeting days after the Robb Elementary School massacre. This insensitive move demonstrates the NRA’s audacity to push for gun rights in a time when thousands of families grieve the loss of their loved ones. The association claims that it is “committed to making schools secure” but it is only in the guise of hypocrisy.\n\nAlthough democrat states including New York and California are making concerted efforts to counter gun violence through bills and gun buyback programs, these efforts will never budge GOP members. Schools, colleges, theaters and bars will continue to be targets of mass shootings because second amendment rights hold more value than human life in Republican states.\n\nSo, where is the middle ground if there is no solution to gun control at all? The key is to keep gun laws intact but changing the eligibility criteria of who qualifies to own a gun. A person with a history of mental illness should never have access to guns. This begs the question: how do you know someone is mentally unfit to own a gun? That is where running thorough background checks comes into play. These background checks can help curb a potential mass shooter from committing mass murder.\n\nIn addition, the legal age to own a gun should be raised from 18 years to at least 21. Right now, individuals 18 and older can be sold long guns, which is alarming given that two 18 year-olds were responsible for the deadliest school shootings in America (Sandy Hook and the recent Robb Elementary School shootings). Countries such as Norway, Canada, New Zealand and Australia managed to curb gun violence through smart gun laws. The rate of mass shootings has sharply declined in these countries. Perhaps the US should extract valuable lessons and parallel similar gun reform strategies, if not exactly the same.\n\nThe media plays a very essential role to get the word about gun control out to the public. If media agencies including digital, print and broadcast, set aside their political differences and harmonise to address gun violence and gun control, things can steer in the right direction. Media coverage of mass shootings across the country can raise more alarm about gun violence in America, which can lead to protests, political pressure and ultimately, some form of resolution.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/OHKOJWUK2FLT7FEKYXS47ABT3I1653551321-0/OHKOJWUK2FLT7FEKYXS47ABT3I1653551321-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Why developing countries should not reduce their reliance on fossil fuels", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97593/why-developing-countries-should-not-reduce-their-reliance-on-fossil-fuels", "date_published": "Fri, 03 Jun 22 09:57:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn just 24 days in 2022, an average American had produced more carbon than an average Pakistani would produce in the whole year. In just three days, an average Australian emits more carbon dioxide than his counterpart would do in the whole year in Niger. The video gaming industry in the United States (US) consumes more electricity than any country in Africa. Of the total 1.5 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere since the middle of the 18th century, 70 per cent has been produced by the US, China, Europe and Russia, with the US being the largest emitter by far. \n\nThese are some of the facts that reflect a wide gap between posturing by the rich countries of the world of being considerate of the environment and the deplorable ground reality.\n\nThe richest countries are home to half of the world’s population and emit 86 per cent of the world’s total carbon dioxide emissions. If we are to improve the climate and limit global heating to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, carbon emissions have to be curbed and more action is required from the rich and developed countries. Many in the developing world are of the opinion that the global north has already benefited from fossil fuels and now that it has all the means and resources to shift to cleaner energy, it is imposing the same on the global south where people are yet to attain a higher standard of living. Critical energy projects for less economically developed countries are being banned under the garb of environmental conservation.\n\nAt the 26th Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) held in 2021, more than 20 countries – including the US and some European nations – pledged to stop foreign fossil fuel financing while giving no indication of curbing their domestic production and expansion. Such two-faced actions do more harm than good: one, by pushing poor countries further to the brink; and two, by making a mockery of environmentalism and snatching away its true spirit and purpose.\n\nIn a similar move, China announced last year that it won’t build new coal-fired power plants abroad. China has been the major contributor to Pakistan’s coal-powered energy sector in the recent past. Pakistan has total coal reserves of more than 185 billion tonnes and ranks seventh among the countries with the largest lignite coal reserves. These reserves can ensure sustainable development by keeping the economic and social pillars of sustainability intact through empowerment, improved well-being and availability of opportunities for the present and future generations.\n\nDepriving the developing world of growth and development by curbing the supply of fossil fuels or by halting investments in fossil-generated energy projects will deteriorate beleaguered economies. It is important that the global south be allowed to follow the same path to development as the global north took, that is, by ensuring development through industrialisation, even if it came through the use of fossil fuels. Economic prosperity will, in fact, enable the availability of necessary resources and capital to protect another pillar of sustainability – the environment. This doesn’t mean that development will necessarily come at the expense of the environment. Environmentally-friendly fuel to energy conversion technologies can be used to mitigate harmful environmental impacts. Instead of curbing the funding of fossil-generated energy projects, the richer countries should invest in the use of less harmful methods of energy generation through fossil fuels.\n\nReadily available and economically viable energy options are the need of the hour for many developing countries like Pakistan, without which the achievement of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will remain a distant dream.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1080201-SmokestackinChinaCarbonemissionsAFPxx-1459978271/1080201-SmokestackinChinaCarbonemissionsAFPxx-1459978271.jpg"}, {"headline": "It’s not about being pro-abortion, it’s about being pro-choice", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97578/its-not-about-being-pro-abortion-its-about-being-pro-choice", "date_published": "Sat, 07 May 22 10:24:08 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSome interesting developments (or lack thereof) have surfaced about the abortion laws in the United States (US).

Even though this leaked draft is not the final verdict or opinion of the court, it has however sparked a serious wave of reactions and disappointment from abortion rights advocates. If the final call reflects the opinion draft, America will see a drastic shift regarding abortion rights in the country.\n\nFor anyone not already familiar with the original Roe v Wade, here is a quick description and a somewhat lengthy explanation about its significance for women’s rights. A landmark decision was taken in 1973 by the US Supreme Court that ruled that the Constitution of the US protected women’s liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restrictions. This decision ultimately opened up safe spaces and clinics for women who wished to have abortions done, with services provided by fully trained and licensed physicians. The decision ultimately explained that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution provides “a right to privacy” which protects a pregnant woman’s rights to choose. Furthermore, the court reasoned those outlawing abortions would violate a pregnant woman’s right to privacy for reasons such as:\n\n\n\thaving unwanted children would lead to a distressful life and future for the woman;\n\tit may cause long-term psychological harm which could result in poor care of the child considering the mother’s weak physical and mental health;\n\tand because there may be “distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child”.\n\n\nThe decision was celebrated by abortion rights advocates as this was a huge move towards recognising women’s rights when it came to making their own choices about their bodies. And why shouldn’t it be? The benefits of legalised abortion are plentiful – fewer illegitimate births, smaller welfare costs, less children born as a result of rape. However, according to Alito, the constitution makes no such reference to abortion and that no such right is implicitly protected by the constitutional provision.\n\nTherefore, the overturning of Roe v Wade would lead to stricter limits on abortion access largely in the South and Midwest, with about half of the states set to immediately enforce broad abortion bans. On the other hand, the following 16 states have laws in place to protect the right to abortion: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\n\nWhy this debate is causing such an uproar is not only because this is overall a huge setback for women’s right to choose what they want to do with their bodies but also the deep negative impact the ban will have (if implemented) on women who are prevented from obtaining abortions. Some of these adverse consequences include mental, physical and financial impacts. It has been proven in several studies that being denied an abortion is linked with an increase in anxiety, stress and lower self-esteem shortly after the denial. Women who are denied abortions also experience financial hardship, including an increase in household poverty considering there are additional mouths to feed and there are no strict laws around having the biological father provide child care support.\n\nIf abortion is to be banned and women’s bodies are to be controlled by a bunch of old white men, then perhaps they should also consider the consequences this will have on those very women, especially rape victims who have to carry the child of their abuser for nine months and then live with that trauma forever; while also being at risk of being contacted by the rapist for child custody or continued sexual violence and harassment. The ban would also greatly impact teenage mothers, sex workers and/or those women who become pregnant in cases of premarital and extramarital affairs. The fear of raising the child alone and being financially incapable of raising the child are of the top most reasons of pregnancy termination. Another very common reason for terminating a pregnancy is known as “young age pregnancy”, which ultimately would affect the young girl’s life negatively, while restricting her mobility and opportunities. Why is it that controlling women’s bodies and hindering their bodily autonomy is always up for debate, yet men’s accountability is hardly ever spoken about?\n\nA better draft opinion to read about would’ve been the US Supreme Court leaning towards providing free vasectomies for men. It’s a fairly painless and reversible process which does not cause any kind of long-term psychological or physical ailments. If men who get women pregnant can ‘choose’ not be part of the raising process, they should be encouraged to undergo the medical procedure so as to not cause pregnancies at all. The procedure can be reversed if and when they decide to have children consensually with their partner. But of course, restricting men’s bodily autonomy would be of the utmost disgrace and disrespect.\n\nAccording to Alito’s draft opinion, the idea that the abortion bans reflect the subjugation of women in American society is wrong considering women still have electoral and political power. By this logic, if women possess the right to vote or hold a public position, they should completely give up the right to decide what they want to do with their bodies because a few people who don’t even have a uterus can feel important about themselves. I wonder if these people who have decided to put these rights up for debates in the first place have even researched about the topic at all. It is actually quite obvious that despite the bans on abortions, they will continue to take place, only they will be unsafe and painful ones. Post-abortion care is essential for addressing disabilities caused by induced or self-induced abortions because they can surely be taken care of. However, the likelihood of women having access to post-abortion care and services will be practically zero in the states where the ban is to be implemented.\n\nThe US claims to be a superpower leading the world with its impeccable score on all fronts as a nation, but ironically their conservative ideas around minority rights have always remained questionable. These abortion laws are no different. Abortion is a reality, which is why it is essential that women be provided with affordable and easily accessible services without any pre-conceived notions and biases. The right to choose is a fundamental one and courts should challenge their abortion laws instead of executing bans that are only an attack on women’s freedom. If there is a ban which needs to be implemented immediately it is America’s gun laws which take more lives than abortions, with conviction rates of criminals at a disappointingly low rate, especially if the shooter is described as a white male. Pro-life advocates who are for the ban need to rethink their priorities and direct their energy into making more sensible arguments and fight for the justice of innocent children and adults who have been killed during school hours or in movie theatres by white American men who have the freedom to legally obtain a weapon over the counter, that too without a license or any understandable reason.\n\nThis is not about being pro-abortion, this is about being pro-choice, that no matter what your personal feelings or beliefs about abortion are, you understand it is not your place to make a decision for another woman about what she can and cannot do with her body.\n\nTo know where Pakistan stands on abortion laws, you can read my detailed piece here.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651920521-0/Cover1651920521-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Follow Riasat-e-Medina in Pakistan but not in Medina itself", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97576/follow-riasat-e-medina-in-pakistan-but-not-in-medina-itself", "date_published": "Sat, 30 Apr 22 10:01:34 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tYou know things have truly gone down the drain when local politics in Pakistan is unnecessarily taken out of context, literally, and used as a sorry excuse to spread hatred, ignorance, violence and blatant sexism. In the most recent case of embarrassing and shameful events, supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) went ahead and created complete havoc at Masjid-e-Nabawi without thinking twice about the historical and religious importance of the very ground they stood on.\n\nIn case they forgot, here is a quick reminder: Masjid-e-Nabawi is one of the most sacred places in Medina for Muslims. Considering Pakistanis have self-appointed themselves as the sole protectors of Islam for so long by protecting and defending blasphemy laws in the hope of punishing (even if wrongly) those who apparently disrespect Islam, this very act in Medina has proved that nothing – not even a place of worship during one of the holiest months for Muslims – can stop these devils from showing their true colours.\n\nThere is a nasty video being circulated on social media showing a bunch of men chanting slogans of “chor, chor” (thieves) at some members of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s delegation in Medina. Not only that, it is clearly visible and audible the highly disrespectful and profane language and slogans being hurled at the current Federal Minister of Information and Broadcasting Maryam Aurangzeb. Using disrespectful and disconcerting sexist slogans against women is so outdated but, since a patriarchal induced understanding of gender and culture plagues this country so deeply, this is hardly a surprise. Degrading and violating women has long been used as a tool and indicator of victory in wars, and this, it seems, is no different – especially since Imran Khan keeps comparing this whole political escapade to the battle of Karbala.\n\nThe harassment faced by various members of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) while performing their religious duties has raised eyebrows across the globe as Pakistanis are yet again being highlighted for their deranged actions. The sanctity of the holy mosque has been spoiled and there is no justification for carrying out dirty political agendas on holy sites.\n\nAs if the political garbage that we’re witnessing first-hand in Pakistan wasn’t enough, we are now a mere laughing spectacle for those nations whom we have tried to convince otherwise in the hopes of building amicable relations. As if our perceived association with terrorism wasn’t enough, this has added another feather to our embarrassment cap. If Imran set out to create a Riasat-e-Medina in Pakistan, perhaps he should give sermons to his followers on how to effectively follow the rules of Medina in Medina at the very least. It’s obvious that pre-planning this stunt did not go the way he wished. Sadly, and evidently, this cult mentality has brought politically blinded citizens to a point where they see nothing wrong with what they did. Many have not even bothered to condemn this awful incident, and the rest are still finding ways to justify it.\n\nYes, every citizen of a country should be well-aware and critical of the politics of their country and should be able to question their leaders whenever they see irregularities, injustices and/or discrimination taking place. But to be politically charged to this extent is very dangerous since some Pakistanis will export their violent and extremist attitudes to the countries which have allowed them in, further causing global isolation. These actions are mostly perpetuated by men, and usually women have to pay the price. But alas, when a so-called leader openly supports sexual harassers and believes in victim-shaming, one can hardly expect any wise, well-thought out and grounded decision-making.\n\nI am amazed at how effortlessly all of this has been planned and implemented. This particular incident reeks of misogyny and hypocrisy at all levels. It is obvious that this will destabilise and polarise the nation further, and will make violence an acceptable form of ‘protest’. The common saying “politics can be dirty” is an understatement in the case of Pakistan. Our politics is not only ours, it’s for the entire world to find entertainment in. But, more importantly, it is a disgrace to the religion we hold so dear.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651313943-0/Cover1651313943-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Are we on the brink of a global recession?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97575/are-we-on-the-brink-of-a-global-recession", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Apr 22 08:21:09 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSince Covid-19 brought the world to a halt in 2020, life has been nothing short of a nightmare. We have already seen unprecedented national lockdowns, social distancing measures, overburdened hospitals, and mass casualties all over the world. However, with the introduction of vaccinations, we assumed the horror was finally over, but nothing could be farther from the truth. With inflation on the rise, widespread supply chain bottlenecks, and rising geopolitical tensions, governments face a monumental task in steering their countries away from a crisis. Looking at the current global situation, it is clear that we are in deep waters and may be on the verge of a global recession.\n\nWith economies all over the world reopening and consumers returning to markets, the main issue that central banks are dealing with is rising consumer prices. To combat inflation from rising any further, central banks started winding down their quantitative easing measures put in place at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, these measures were rendered ineffective due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which exacerbated global supply chains and drove commodity prices to historic highs, adding fuel to the already raging fire.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict has been detrimental to oil and gas prices, which have risen sharply. Furthermore, the two countries are large exporters of agricultural commodities, and account for nearly 14% of global wheat trade. Similarly, Russia and Ukraine account for nearly 19% of global barley exports and nearly 52% of global sunflower oil exports.\n\nIt is also important to note that, because Russia is a major fertiliser exporter, sanctions against the country could have a negative impact on fertiliser supply around the world, lowering crop yields. Russia is also a major supplier of valuable minerals such as palladium, titanium, nickel, and neon. Palladium, in particular, is a critical component in automobile manufacturing, and its price has increased astronomically since the war began. Supply disruptions in these commodities from Russia and Ukraine have driven up consumer prices even further.\n\nAside from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, China’s zero-Covid policy is causing mayhem in commodity supplies all over the world. The imposition of strict lockdowns and travel restrictions is harming demand and economic growth in the world's second-largest economy. Shanghai, the world’s busiest container port, is closed due to an uptick in coronavirus infections in the region. As a result, hundreds of cargo ships have been stranded in the port.\n\nMoving forward, China's return to a Covid-zero state is highly unlikely given the likelihood of new coronavirus variants emerging in the future. As a result, the global economy is predicted to stay under pressure, at least in the short term, and inflation is expected to continue its upward trend, forcing central banks to continue hiking interest rates until the global macroeconomic outlook stabilises.\n\nConsequently, given the Russia-Ukraine war and the slowing down of China’s economy, policymakers around the world are considering the likelihood of the global economy entering into a recession. According to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the growth of the global economy will drop to 2.8% in 2022. Earlier, it had predicted that the global economy would expand by nearly 4.1% before Russia declared war on Ukraine. Similarly, as per WoodMac, a research and consultancy company, the global economy is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2022 and 0.7% in 2023.\n\nInvestors around the world are already tweaking their strategies and becoming more cautious as uncertainty in global markets continues to rise. This is clear from the inversion of the American Treasury yield curve, which indicates that investors are shifting away from risky equities and towards short-term fixed income bonds in an attempt to protect themselves from the possibility of the global economy slowing down in the short term. Furthermore, fund managers around the world are also increasing the weightage of cash in their portfolios.\n\nConsidering the aforementioned warning signs such as rising inflation, inversion of the American treasury yield curve, and portfolio reallocation by global fund managers, the likelihood of the global economy entering a recession in the short term is high. Hence, countries are at a critical juncture where policymakers must be proactive in dealing with the looming issues, and governments should be actively seeking for ways to protect their respective countries from the implications of a global recession.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651134728-0/Cover1651134728-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "From India to Bharat", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97566/from-india-to-bharat", "date_published": "Wed, 06 Apr 22 10:18:47 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIf centuries of plunder in the subcontinent, communal rifts and destructive power struggles were someone’s fault, whose were they? Were they ours? Was it theirs? I’m still searching for the answers but what I do know is that our past divided us then and it continues to divide us now. The fact that Narendra Modi’s India is a polarised state practicing blatant discrimination of minority communal groups and economic classes isn’t news. Modi’s rise to power isn’t an anomaly; it isn’t just a chapter in India’s history – it's a carefully crafted manifestation of an ideology. \n\nHave you ever wondered how and why Jawaharlal Nehru’s “azaad” India has embarked on such a journey? How and why is the very nature of the world’s largest democracy being rebuilt? Is it really that bad?\n\nHindutva: who is a Hindu?\n\nWith the arrival of European missionaries in India, the practice of proselytism not only threatened the socio-religious structure of society, it also brought changes in its demography. To resist the new faith, Hindu reformers endowed their religion with egalitarian values through a reinterpretation of the – highly abstract in nature – Vedas. This led to the creation of a golden age of Hinduism which was then supported by movements such as the Arya Samaj. The 1919 mobilisation of Indian Muslims in support of the Caliphate of Constantinople – the Khilafat movement – solidified the “majoritarian inferiority complex” of the Hindus due to its Pan-Islamic nature.\n\nIt was in this context that VD Savarkar codified the Hindu nationalist ideology, citing four factors in determining the eligibility of a “Hindu” – race (Aryan decent and Vedic fathers), territory (Vedic land where the holy rivers flow), language (Sanskrit) and culture. Savarkar also pointed out the similarities between his definition of “who is a Hindu” and the Zionists. MS Golwalkar’s views on the topic went one step ahead. He believed that Muslims of India did not deserve “even citizen rights” in the Hindu state. Their only option was to either submit or leave. These were the narratives which led to the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1925.\n\nTowards BJP\n\nThe organisation which started off by combating communists grew into a tentacular Sangh Parivar over the years with numerous sector-based organisations that gradually saturated the social space. The aim of the Sangh Parivar is state formation, not mere state-building. RSS entered the political arena in the 1950s after Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination by an alleged member of the movement and a close aid of Savarkar. Undoubtedly a dark time in the RSS’s history, the national outrage led to the arrests of 20,000 Swayamsevaks and the outlawing of the organisation which Nehru saw as an “Indian embodiment of fascism”. The Bharatiya Janata Sangh (BJS) was created by Golwalkar in 1951 in response to these developments.\n\nIn the time leading up to Modi’s rule in Gujrat, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, formerly BJS) had garnered considerable support in India, capitalising on its role in the Ayodhya Movement which resulted in violent clashes between the Hindu and Muslim communities during the “Ram Yatra”. Since then, the BJP has emerged as a populist party in India’s ethnic democracy which is against any and all things it deems a threat to the RSS ideology. The BJP’s primary targets are Muslims and Indian secularism. Its more concealed motives include the continued socioeconomic repression of the other backward classes (OBCs) and the scheduled castes (SCs), together with a complete dismantling of the very ethos of India’s once renowned impartial institutions.\n\nA lesson in populism \n\nIf there was ever a book titled “populism for dummies”, an account of Modi’s rise to power is sure to make an appearance. A product of the RSS, Modi in a true populist fashion rose to power following the Gujrat riots. During this time, violence was promoted and validated against Muslims, the “other”, by Modi and RSS radicals in response to the Godhra tragedy. Communal differences were then exacerbated to a point of no return, and it is from here that Modi’s populism turned into national populism. His humble beginnings helped him connect with the masses on an unprecedented scale and his shrewdness coupled with charisma propelled him into the status of an “ideal”. He was at once borne out of a mythology yet remained rooted in reality.\n\nDistancing himself from the Muslims, Modi established himself as an “Emperor of The Hindu Hearts”. His economic policies accelerated the growth rate in Gujrat – albeit at the expense of the proletariat – which would later lead him to tout the “Gujrat Model” in his 2014 election campaign. Subsequently, in the 2000s, when Islamic terrorism was at its peak, Modi would find himself at the centre of assassination attempts supposedly sponsored by ‘jihadis’. It did not matter that there was a complete lack of evidence to support the claims that the Pakistani state was behind this supposed threat, or that the ‘jihadis’ arrested were later acquitted by the Indian courts. He had established his national populist repertoire – a feat which would get him elected as the prime minister for two consecutive terms.\n\nThe first term \n\nDuring his first term, Modi focused on raising the “self-esteem” and “dignity” of the Indian people by introducing programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jan-Dhan Yojana, and Ujjwala Yojana. While there were no concrete reforms to help raise the economic status of his newly created “neo-middle class” or the poor, he also scaled back on the previously launched pro-poor programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Modi’s urban consumer bias was apparent in the economic policies put forth which facilitated crony capitalism. He diverted the people’s attention by focusing on social justice and keeping communal violence brewing to appease his “angry young men” who had taken the law into their own hands primarily through vigilantism (The Bajrang Dal).\n\nThis constant cycle of fear of the “Other” converting into anger was apparent in the activities of the Gau Rakshak Dal. Moreover, campaigns against ‘love jihad’ and ‘land jihad’ further unveiled the anti-Muslim sentiments of not only the state but Indian society as well. In the larger scheme of things, Modi’s politics led to the banalisation of Hindutva, reformation of the education system in line with the RSS ideology, crackdown on secularists and free press, ‘reconversion’ campaigns, opening up the state apparatus to the RSS, and deterioration of India’s once revered institutions including the police, Supreme Court, media, and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\n\nModi 2.0\n\nBy the 2019 elections, India had already converted into a “De-Facto Hindu Rashtra”. Staying true to his saintly politics, Modi centered his campaign on an “external enemy” – Pakistan. The Balakot strikes following the Pulwama attack, together with Pakistan’s goodwill gesture of Wing Commander Abhinandan’s release were hailed as ‘victories’ in India. Interestingly, Bharat, by then, had embarked on a path towards electoral authoritarianism, thus the main opposition parties barely stood a chance.\n\nCapitalising off caste politics and plebian support for the “strong man”, the BJP, with the conquest of the Rajya Sabha, was now in a position to fulfill its primary objectives – the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the abrogation of Article 370. The Ayodhya verdict was the final nail in India’s secular identity. Christophe Jaffrelot thereby concludes that India is now an ethnic democracy wherein the Hindus are bound by racial, linguistic, religious or other such cultural characteristics. Their strong sense of identity is pivotal for the rejection of the “other” which isn’t protected by the government nor the international community.\n\nThe greatest divide \n\nIn a democratic structure, regardless of the adjectives, claiming to be ‘apolitical’ is perhaps the highest tier of ignorance. If democracy is a government by the people, for the people, and from the people, how can the two ever be separated? Of course, outliers do exist, but when a feat is present in majority, it becomes the norm. BJP’s anti-Muslim bias, RSS’s Hindutva ideology, and Modi’s populist politics exist and thrive in India, for the Indian people, by the Indian citizens, from the Indian society. India’s polarisation was triggered by deep-seated insecurities, and with multiple fears and numerous threats – real or fake – assimilation becomes the best course of action. While there is beauty in diversity, there is security in homogenisation. It looks like the people of India have chosen their rulers. Where this majoritarian rule leads Bharat will unravel a new chapter in the history of war itself – the Greatest Divide is yet to come.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1649243028-0/Cover1649243028-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "What should be on the OIC’s agenda?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97560/what-should-be-on-the-oics-agenda", "date_published": "Tue, 22 Mar 22 11:13:05 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) signed a charter in 1969 aiming for peace, solidarity and mutual economic development. One premium objective of the charter is the commitment of the states to following ‘International Law.’ The charter also profoundly adopts the fundamental freedoms, human rights and good governance for development as the core of the international policy system and organisational structure. Although criticised, another landmark development under the OIC system was the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, which complements the Declaration on Human Rights and other United Nations (UN) human rights instruments.\n\nFurthermore, the Astana Declaration as policy guidance for investment in science, technology, education and development is significant for the effective implementation of sustainable development goals or the development agenda of 2030. As the OIC is the second largest intergovernmental organisation after the UN, it was expected that it would be safeguarding Muslim rights and interests in the global policy system.\n\nHowever, the charter governing the 1.8 billion in the contemporary era of globalisation is still seeking an effective implementation plan because most of the developing and underdeveloped Muslim states are equipped with poor governance and mismanaged structures. The objectivity of the OIC in the developmental agenda counters the hegemony and individualistic approaches. As members of the OIC are currently meeting in Islamabad, it is worth considering what the OIC should aim to achieve over the coming years.\n\nThe member states of the OIC implemented non-interference in their internal matters and pursued secular interests over the developmental agenda. The war among a few Muslim States is one example. Foreign intervention is another. This simultaneously indicated in the past that Muslim states’ inter-relations in sub-systems cannot be translated into one big policy umbrella. The given issues also highlight the apparent reasons for not having any meaningful Muslim representation in the global policy system.\n\nThe pertinent question now is how the OIC, as the key representing the authority of Muslim states, can be effective in the global policy system. OIC theoretically attempted to portray itself as an organisation that upholds the ‘global Islamic agenda’, and that it is somehow similar to the UN instruments reflecting human rights, peace and sustainable development. To implement the human rights agenda effectively, the OIC must think about an organisational structure that may monitor and report to the authorities. There could be a multilateral court of justice following the regional judicial systems of Europe, Africa and South America.\n\nMore legitimisation of the OIC through establishing a meaningful ‘executive’ under the sub-state system shall present a robust approach towards implementing the local agenda of 2030. The OIC may also think about more sub-committees or sub-groups on diverse but common development policy programmes.\n\nAlthough it seems that the OIC has a limited role in the effective implementation of the agenda of Muslim states, the OIC may rethink how the local implementation of global agendas can help its voice in the global policy system. The OIC can bring together the states and people for common issues such as climate change, poverty eradication, human development and environmentalism.\n\nWhat is more prominent is that the initial establishment of the OIC emphasised the ‘Ummah,’ which may encompass the Muslim representation worldwide and welcome integration of other states with the Muslim population. More importantly, the affiliation in the OIC system as a non-observer state can be closely linked to present challenges of corruption, poor governance, unsustainable development, climate change and environmental crises.\n\nIt is undeniable that financial assistance is the only way forward for such agendas, and for such purposes, more extensive integration in the OIC of developed states cannot be avoided. So far, the challenges of inequitable growth and development are not addressed by the international policy systems and are unlikely to be resolved. The UN 2030 agenda has already suggested regional and sub-regional integration for common goals towards more considerable cooperation.\n\nIf the OIC is seeking an influential role in the sustainable development agenda of 2030, it should reframe its existing governance mechanism. The recognition of the future development agenda as suggested by the UN shall be recognised by the OIC and shall address the 17 primary goals for human development in the Muslim states. In doing so, the OIC must reconsider the assistance of policy experts, academia, social scientists, stakeholders and specific-area experts. Such initiatives will provide the OIC with valuable global representation.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1647948826-0/Cover1647948826-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "India’s institutionalised prejudice against Islamophobia", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97557/indias-institutionalised-prejudice-against-islamophobia", "date_published": "Fri, 18 Mar 22 10:35:30 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIndia recently called out the United Nations (UN) resolution which declares May 15th as the International Day to combat Islamophobia. TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, expressed concern that an emphasis on one religion takes away attention from the phobias against Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism. He states that India had offered sanctuary to Zoroastrians, Jews and others in the spirit of pluralism and expressed concern regarding the attack on gurudwaras (Sikh temples), the destruction of Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, and the glorification of the breaking of idols. Tirumurti further said he instead preferred the generic term religion-phobia to combat hatred against all religions.\n\nSuch a position was to be expected from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) India, which is bent on ‘decolonising’ the influence of past Muslim invaders by furthering the dharmic faiths (Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism) at the expense of demonising present-day Muslims and Islam. The fact that the ruling party remains strategically quiet when calls for genocide of Muslims are made is a testament to this observation. Scores of Hindutva trolls are usually out and about on Pakistani and other social media sites where they demonise Muslims and perpetuate their victimhood despite being an overwhelming majority in India. It is against this backdrop that the Indian representative brazenly projected his country’s institutionalised prejudice.\n\nHowever, Tirumurti conveniently failed to recognise and mention the systemic genocide of the Rohingya Muslims by Buddhists in Myanmar, the concentration camps of Uighurs in China, the mass destruction of Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq in a post 9/11 world that has led to the universal singling out of Muslims and Islam. He ignored the fact that two billion Muslims are often generalised and stereotyped as terrorists and that many Sikhs in the West are targeted not because of their Sikhism but because they are perceived as Muslims. In other words, the targeting of people of colour and Sikhs in the West is also because of Islamophobia.\n\nIt is true that Hindu girls face forced conversion in the Sindh province of Pakistan, but this oppression is unique to that province (based on feudalism) and is not found in Arab countries. Similarly, the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was perpetrated by the rogue Taliban and not other Afghans who have enjoyed good relations with India. In fact, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has recently facilitated the construction of a large Hindu temple as well. The same goes for Pakistan that unilaterally took steps to facilitate Sikh pilgrims to their holy sites in Pakistan. If anything, it was the Indian government that took draconian steps against Sikhs and the Golden Temple in the mid-80s.\n\nThe Indian representative mentioned the glorification of the breaking of idols, which is reminiscent of the past Muslim invaders from central Asia in the age of empires. However, those Muslim invaders from Persia, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and other central Asian places are long dead. It was a different time where human rights violations were perpetrated by anyone and everyone. The sacking of Baghdad by the Mongols is one such example. However, the BJP and its leader Narendra Modi seem fixated on the past and not on the present where their government has singled out and marginalised Muslims through the Citizenship Act.\n\nThe whatbaoutism of the Indian state in an attempt to deflect attention away from Islamophobia towards “religion-phobia” is clear for everyone to see. The words of Tirumurti remind us of those white supremacists who argue against “Black Lives Matter” by responding with “All Lives Matter”, or of those homophobes who argue against the Pride Parade by resorting to the inanities of “what about Straight Parade”.\n\nIt is time India stops comparing itself to Pakistan, which itself has huge issues of intolerance, and starts addressing its internal issues of the systemic discrimination and Hindutva calls for genocide of their own Muslim minorities.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1647603749-0/Cover1647603749-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistani migrants bounce back", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2370889/pakistani-migrants-bounce-back", "date_published": "Fri, 12 Aug 22 20:47:25 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe number of Pakistani nationals migrating for work mostly to the Gulf countries has bounced back to the pre-Covid-19 level to around 65,000 per month in January 2022 in the wake of rising income of oil exporting Arab countries and advanced economies around the world.\n\n“The monthly flow of Pakistani workers (abroad) has reverted to pre-Covid levels,” the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in its half-yearly report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for July-December of fiscal year 2021-22 released on Friday.\n\nOver 70% of Pakistani workers go to GCC countries mostly to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nThe number of migrating Pakistani workers plunged to zero during the initial five months of the pandemic – April-August 2020, according to the central bank’s report.\n\nThe normalisation of the flow of workers to foreign countries along with a surge in the income of oil exporting GCC countries indicates the inflow of workers’ remittances to Pakistan will remain steady at around “$32 billion in the current fiscal year 2023 compared to $31 billion in FY22”, Topline Research projected last week.\n\nAs many as 458,257 Pakistanis proceeded abroad for employment in the first seven months (January-July) of 2022. This translates into 65,465 in each of the seven months, according to the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment’s (BE&OE) official website.\n\nA record high number of 946,571 Pakistanis went abroad for employment in 2015, translating to 78,881 each month during the year, according to the Bureau.\n\nAccording to the SBP report, it took almost two years to normalise the monthly flow of Pakistani migrants for work to the Middle Easter countries to pre-pandemic level. It was January 2020 when around 65,000 Pakistani went abroad for job purposes last time before the outbreak of the virus in Pakistan in February 2020.\n\nThe central bank’s report said no word on the economic outlook for the current fiscal year 2023, as it usually does in its quarterly, half-yearly and annual reports. Instead, it gave an outdated outlook for the second half (January-June) of FY22.\n\nTo recall, the country achieved economic growth of 6% for the second consecutive fiscal year in 2021-22.\n\nThe central bank said in its latest State of Pakistan’s Economy report that the collection of revenue in taxes to the government increased notably, but mostly due to increased imports during the first half of the previous fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. \n\nFederal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) collection of revenue in taxes increased by 32% in the first half of FY22, notwithstanding somewhat slower growth in the second quarter (Oct-Dec FY22), as economic activities improved and general price levels rose as compared to last year.\n\n“However, most of this increase stemmed from import-related taxes, on account of the broad-based increase in import volumes, international commodity prices, and PKR (Pakistani rupee) depreciation,” SBP said in the report.\n\nThe government, however, sharply cut imports in the first month (July) of the current fiscal year 2022 to $4.9 billion to avert the risk of default on international payments ahead of the resumption of IMF’s extended $7 billion loan programme in last week of the current month of August 2022.\n\nThe imports had hit a five-month high at $2.3 billion in June.\n\nFinance Minister Miftah Ismail said the other day the curb on imports would remain in place over the next three to four-month to improve the country’s capacity to make import payments and foreign debt 946,571 repayments.\n\nThe import curtailment may compromise FBR collection of revenue in taxes in the three to fourth-month of low imports in FY23.\n\nFrom the perspective of the first half of FY22, the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) exhibited broad-based expansion, exports grew buoyant alongside growth in FBR taxes and Kharif crops recorded higher production, the central bank said.\n\nHowever, amid multi-year high global commodity prices, rising inflation and current account deficit posed a challenge as the year progressed, it said.\n\n“These pressures necessitated monetary tightening amidst other regulatory measures to moderate demand.”­­\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 13th, 2022.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/41660337318-0/41660337318-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Senate panel seeks details of PIA pilots", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2310861/senate-panel-seeks-details-of-pia-pilots", "date_published": "Fri, 16 Jul 21 06:16:48 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Senate Standing Committee on Aviation on Thursday sought details of the pilots working with the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and was briefed on the functions of the Aviation Division and its attached departments.\n\nThe committee meeting, chaired by Hidayatullah, reviewed working procedures, budget, number of employees, challenges faced by the Aviation Division and its subsidiaries and the performance of the institutions.\n\nAmong others, the meeting was attended by senators Syed Muhammad Sabir Shah, Faisal Saleem Rehman, Mian Raza Rabbani, Aun Abbas, Faisal Javed, Saleem Mandviwalla, Afnanullah Khan, Dilawar Khan and Sherry Rehman, besides Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Aviation Secretary Ali, Adviser to CEO PIA Amir Hayat, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Director General Flight Lieutenant (retd) Khaqan Murtaza, Airport Security Force chief security officer, Pakistan Meteorological Department director general and other senior officials.\n\nIt also looked into the measures taken by the Aviation Division to improve performance of the attached departments and its future plans to tackle challenges confronted on the professional front.\n\nIt was the committee's first meeting after its reconstitution followed by the Senate elections.\nHidayatullah said the committee proceedings would be made more effective with mutual consultation of the members so that the confronted issues could be removed in an efficient manner.

Kamran Ghulam\n\nKamran Ghulam may not be a household name yet since he hasn’t represented Pakistan national team till now, but people who follow domestic cricket closely know him as the next big thing.\n\nThe right-handed batsman, in the recently concluded Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, bettered the record for most runs in a single QeA Trophy season. The record, earlier held by Saadat Ali with 1217 runs, was broken by Ghulam in the final of the tournament where he was representing Khyber-Pakhtukhwa.\n\nHowever, this is not the only thing that pushed Wasim to include the 25-year-old in the squad.\n\nGhulam boasts a first-class average of over 53 with 31 matches to his name. He has scored nine 100s and 11 fifties to amass 2,413 runs, with a highest score of 166.\n\nIf he can build on his current domestic form when playing against South Africa, the visitors will find it hard to beat Pakistan in the two-Test series.\n\n2. Tabish Khan\n\nIf you’re a pacer outside Pakistan, you’ll probably start your career in mid or late-twenties and end it after your mid-thirties. However, right-arm medium pacer Tabish Khan will start his international career at 36.\n\nSome may say he was not international material, but with 598 wickets in 137 first-class matches, there is and there never was a valid reason to keep him out of the national fray. Well, he’s not the only one who had to wait a long time to get his chance, Fawad Alam is another case study in this regard too.\n\nThere is light at the end of every tunnel and Tabish had to travel miles to find his light and he would love to grab the chance with both hands when he bowls to the South Africans in Karachi and Rawalpindi in the two Tests.\n\nJury is out on whether he will be able to live up to the hype after spending his heydays in the domestic wilderness, but if Tabish wants to question a system which gives multiple chances to a few and nearly zero to some, he will have to utilise all the experience he has gained and get his first and maybe final hurrah on the international level.\n\n3. Saud Shakeel\n\nAnother youngster, with heaps of runs behind him and a first-class average of nearly 49, Saud Shakeel will don the greens of Pakistan during the two Tests against South Africa.\n\nAt the age 25, Shakeel has 3220 runs in his books in 46 first-class outings. He also has 10 tons and 17 fifties to boast about and if this is not enough, he can bowl left-arm slow.\n\nShakeel has come to the fore through the Pakistan cricket ranks and has played for the U19 team, which may prove to be a point in his favour as he had the grooming of a cricketer from an early age.\n\nAll in all, Pakistan have played a big gamble by benching their usual suspects and giving the domestic performers a chance to shine. This move may turn new chief selector Wasim into a hero that many were waiting for, however it can backfire too.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Kamran-Ghulam-PCB1611139704-0/Kamran-Ghulam-PCB1611139704-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "4 players who can help Pakistan beat New Zealand in third T20I", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2276840/4-players-who-can-help-pakistan-beat-new-zealand-in-third-t20i", "date_published": "Mon, 21 Dec 20 09:53:42 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan are against the ropes in the three-match T20I series against New Zealand as they’ve lost the opening two games and only a win in third shortest-format game can help them gain much-needed confidence when going into the Tests.\n\nPakistan stayed rigid in their approach and played the same elevens in the first two T20Is, but with the series already lost, it is high time Pakistan try something new on the field against New Zealand.\n\nWhile the option of chasing may present itself if Pakistan win the toss third time on the trot, a few changes in the eleven can also be beneficial for the stand-in captain Shadab Khan.\n\nHere are the three players who can walk in and help Pakistan win the third T20I against New Zealand.\n\n1. Sarfaraz Ahmed\n\nIf you ask a Pakistani cricket fan why Sarfaraz Ahmed was sent into the wilderness, even after taking Pakistan to the summit of the T20I rankings, they would not mention his batting, his wicketkeeping or his captaincy, but they’d rather blame it on him being a Karachi player.\n\nWhether this theory of the Pakistan Cricket Board being biased against Karachi players is true or not, one thing everyone can agree on is that Sarfaraz brings something to the field which many other players can’t – the much-needed energy.\n\nSarfaraz was famous for his animated and chatty wicketkeeping when he was captaining Pakistan in all formats and even though some may disagree, the energy he brought with his shenanigans was contagious.\n\nHim walking to the bowler before and after every delivery, his comments when someone dropped a catch or did a great job in the fielding, all of that is missed with Muhammad Rizwan behind the stumps.\n\nWith Shadab at the helm against a New Zealand side which he is finding very difficult to outwit, an experienced former captain behind the stumps can go a long way in helping Pakistan enforce a win when everything has failed to work.\n\n2 and 3. Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa\n\nWahab Riaz is not doing what he is supposed to do in New Zealand – be the experienced leader of the young bowling pack, and this gives way to Pakistan go for the young but express pace duo of Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa.\n\nInclusion of Musa can also help Shaheen Afridi take a much-needed rest before he is asked to run in and fire on all cylinders during the upcoming Tests.\n\nAlso, if Pakistan really want to make things interesting, they can always replace Haris Rauf with Iftikhar Ahmed. Iftikhar is considered to be a big-hitter, and also can bowl four overs of off-spin. Since New Zealand are perfectly fine when dealing with pacers, a spin of strategy may work in Pakistan’s favour.\n\n4. Usman Qadir\n\nWe all saw what the legendary spinner Abdul Qadir’s son Usman Qadir got from his father – a spin bowling masterclass.\n\nShadab has been off colour in the bowling department in the first two matches, maybe because of his increased focus on batting and recently captaincy and Usman can help fill the shoes of team’s first-choice leggie.\n\nIf there’s a question of who he should replace in the side, anyone between Khushdil Shah and Abdullah Shafique can give way to Usman, as many may still now know that he has the ability to bat quite nicely in the lower order.\n\nPakistan will be concluding their shortest-format series in the third T20I against New Zealand on Tuesday and they will need something new to surprise the hosts and make them submit. However, if they play safe and don’t make any changes, they will surely lose again, with dignity yes, but they will lose.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/comment1608542933-0/comment1608542933-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "3 reasons Pakistan lost first T20I against New Zealand", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2276467/3-reasons-pakistan-lost-first-t20i-against-new-zealand", "date_published": "Fri, 18 Dec 20 12:36:48 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThere was never a doubt that Pakistan would find it difficult to beat New Zealand at the latter’s home and the theory was proven true when the Kiwis beat Men in Green by five wickets in the first T20I of the three-match series on Friday.\n\nWith the defeat, Pakistan will have to pull up their socks for the next two T20Is if they want to salvage the series and win it.\n\nIt was also a sad day for Pakistan stand-in captain Shadab Khan who lost the very first T20I, where he stood as captain.\n\nA closer look of the first T20I shows there were a few things Pakistan could have changed or could have done to prevent the loss in the tour opener.\n\n1. No specialist openers\n\nPakistan won the toss and chose to bat first, but they missed the trick when they asked wicketkeeper-batsman Muhammad Rizwan and newcomer Abdullah Shafique to open the innings against New Zealand.\n\nUnfamiliar with the opening role, Rizwan lost his wicket due to a callous drive and a smart delivery by Jacob Duffy, while Shafique was found out in the second delivery he faced against the Kiwis. Shafique couldn’t fathom the bounce on the pitch and flighted one into the hands of mid-on fielder for an easy catch.\n\nWith the openers gone quickly, as has been the case for Pakistan since eternity, the middle-order, lacking the services of the great Babar Azam, fell like a deck of cards, thus the question of why did Pakistan go with two batsmen upfront who don’t understand the demands of the opener’s role.\n\n2. Batting failure (again)\n\nWith the openers gone, the onus fell on the middle-order to stabilise the innings, but a young Haider Ali was not up to the task. Here, once again, Pakistan did not think twice before sending him at the one-down position, where teams tend to send their best and most in-form batsman.\n\nHaider is all that and a little more, but he lacks the experience of playing at the third spot. However, the next best option to bat at number three, veteran Muhammad Hafeez, did equally bad in batting after being dismissed on the very first ball he faced.\n\nAll thanks to Shadab’s 42 off 32 and a late flurry by Faheem Ashraf, who scored 31 off 18, Pakistan were able to put up a fighting total, but if the top and upper middle-order would have added an extra 20 or 30, the match could’ve shifted in the visitors’ favour.\n\n3. The Wahab dilemma\n\nTo play him or not to play him has become one of the major questions Pakistan faces whenever they go out in the field. If Afridi’s is the pinnacle of mercurial batting, Wahab is all that in the bowling department.\n\nOne day, he would pluck the moon out of the sky for Pakistan and the next day he would turn a certain victory into a miraculous defeat. Is it just bad luck, or is it just his bad bowling at some points, no one can truly answer.\n\nThe latter happened on Friday, when Wahab gave away 45 runs in just 3.5 overs after being hit for two sixes and five fours. New Zealand batsmen were bamboozled in the middle of the innings by some top-notch bowling by Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Faheem Ashraf, but Wahab leaking away runs gave New Zealand the much-needed confidence.\n\nAnd if all that was not enough, Faheem dropped a catch off Wahab at fine leg and to add insult to injury, let the ball crawl away for a four.\n\nIt is quite evident now that people are prone to dropping catches off Wahab’s bowling at fine leg and square leg region. Everyone would remember the disastrous drop in the 2015 World Cup by Rahat Ali where Wahab had setup Shane Watson perfectly with world class short-pitched bowling.\n\nSo, do we curse the man or do we curse his luck, at least I can’t answer this dilemma.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/comment1608294842-0/comment1608294842-0-68779.jpg"}, {"headline": "3 reasons Pakistan will find it difficult to beat New Zealand", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2274087/3-reasons-pakistan-will-find-it-difficult-to-beat-new-zealand", "date_published": "Mon, 30 Nov 20 07:44:32 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan contingent is currently in quarantine in New Zealand as they prepare for face the hosts in three T20Is and two Tests, and there is only one thing that is certain in the current uncertain Covid-19 time – it won’t be easy to beat the Kiwis.\n\nHere are the three main reasons why Babar Azam can return winless, in the series and in all the T20Is and Tests, from New Zealand.\n\n1. Bad morale\n\nAfter news of Pakistani players testing positive surfaced, the team must have seen a fall in their morale as, according to reports, many first team players were affected with the virus.\n\nThis could have led to drop in motivation, while a warning to send the whole squad home after some players breached the Covid-19 protocol was also not inspiring.\n\nPakistan players may be pumped up to beat New Zealand in the latter’s own yard after such humiliation, but with players in gloomy isolation, losing hope and feeling down may be the most probable outcome of the saga.\n\n2. Lack of fitness and practice\n\nEveryone knows about Pakistani’s love for food and our cricketers are just humans. With nothing much to do in hotel rooms, food might be the only entertainment they’ve had through the first half of their quarantine. Hence, a lack of practice may cause lethargy when they hit the ground.\n\nAll this may result in lack of efforts in the field and as the adage of catches win matches goes, a few slipups are a possibility too.\n\nPakistani players will have to put some extra yards in before the matches, otherwise, if they do just enough, the performances will also be just enough and New Zealand will roll over the Men in Green with ease.\n\n3. New Zealand’s form\n\nNew Zealand may not have won many global cricketing tournaments, but they are not known for their big trophy cabinet, they are known for their consistency.\n\nIf they are not the best on a given day, you can surely expect them to be at their minimum best at least. Meanwhile, their opponents Pakistan are known to be the most mercurial cricketing side in the world – “one minute down, next minute up”.\n\nIt is this consistency in New Zealand’s performance that makes them a difficult side to beat and add home advantage to that and it becomes a perfect recipe for Pakistan’s destruction in the series.\n\nAlso, they are unbeaten in the T20Is in the series against West Indies. Their form can be seen in the fact that they have scored quickly in the first two matches, setting a 239-run target in first and chasing a 180-run target in just 16 overs in the second.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistani players last played cricket during the remaining matches of the PSL5.\n\nMomentum will be on New Zealand’s side when they host Pakistan, first for T20Is and then for Tests. Babar will have to come up with a magical formula to lift the spirit of the players who will be feeling under the weather, homesick, and also out of form and practice. If the skipper can do that then he may not only go on to become a batting legend, but also a captain whose name would be written in golden words.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Comment1606722149-0/Comment1606722149-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Is Trump right in saying ‘India is filthy’?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2270253/is-trump-right-in-saying-india-is-filthy", "date_published": "Wed, 28 Oct 20 13:11:05 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhile the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden produced fireworks, Trump’s remarks in the environmental context that “India is filthy”, became a matter of heated debate within Indian media. Indian social media went berserk and its reaction also became prominent on mainstream media. Some went on to ask Trump for an apology on these remarks, which most of Sanghi trolls thought had hurt millions of common Indians.\n\nWhile any nation would react to such remarks from any leader of global stature, Trump’s remarks had a profound effect as Mr Modi has done a lot of work to develop a personal relationship with Trump through the “Howdy,Modi!” rally in the United States and “Namaste Trump” programme duringTrump’s visit to India this year.\n\nWhile we respect Indian sentiments, it may be interesting to conduct an analysis of where does India stand in terms of cleanliness and environment.\n\nAccording to IndiaSpend’sState of Global Air 2020 report,116,000 infants died in India due to air pollution in 2019 — meaning one infant died every five minutes due to air pollution. The data further reveals that 1.67 million Indians died in 2019 due to air pollution causes.\n\nAs per a World Health Organisation report, approximately 120,000 children under the age of five years die due to diarrhoea every year. This indicates that waterborne diseases are rampant in India due to contaminated water and poor sanitation.Hookworms, which can spread through open defecation, cause diarrhoea, anaemia and weight loss in women, according to the report. These problems are linked to low birth weight and slow child growth — 38% of children in India under five are stunted, according to the National Family Health Survey data.\n\nThe Indian magazine, The Wire, reported in 2017, that India, the world’s second-largest country by population, had the highest number of people (732 million) without access to toilets. The report by WaterAid, titled “Out Of Order: The State of the World’s Toilets 2017”, further stated that 355 million women and girls lacked access to a toilet. If they were to stand in a line, the queue could circle the Earth more than four times.\n\nThe problem is that Modi’sSwachh Bharat or Clean India programme built millions of toilets at avery fast pace across Indian landscape; however, these have become dilapidated and unusable,adding to the problem. Adding to that is the factor of demographics: Indian population has grown from 1,330 million in 2017 to 1,380 million in 2019, that’s an additional load of 50 million. So even if India builds one million new toilets every year it cannot match the pace of population growth.\n\nA CNet report published on September 11, 2020, states that India spent $30 billion to fix its broken sanitation. It ended up with more problems. The Swachh Bharat mission, launched in 2014, was an ambitious effort to stop open defecation. It's far from reaching that goal.Lack of enough water to use in Swachh Bharat was bound to make it a failure. Imagine a community toilet built for 500 people in a cramped city with irregular or no supply of water. Within a week, it will not only become unusable but also become a source of disease spread. A survey of open source pictures and videos of Swachh Bharat toilets in overpopulated cities indicates that this grand programme has become a virtual dustbin.\n\nIn 2019, India was also home to 21 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities, studies say, based on air-quality data. Coal usage in power generation stands at a whopping 75% and coal is notoriously bad for environment. No wonder New Delhi maintains the record of being the most polluted capital of the world for the second consecutive year. Even drinking water of the Indian capital is contaminated, The Hindu, in 2019,sarcastically remarked, “If it wasn’t enough that Delhi air is among the world’s most polluted, a new study has now shown that the city’s tap water is the most unsafe among 21 states within India.”\n\nIndian rivers have become almost toxic due to overpopulation and flow of sewage and industrial waste into rivers which hug large cities.Oceanplasticcleanup.com conducted a study of the most filthy, polluted and toxic rivers in the world called the “Dirty Dozen”, and lo and behold, India gets another honour with the Ganges as the second most polluted river in the world and Yamuna as the fifth filthiest.\n\nThe Ganges has a perennial problem of religious rituals.Gangapollution.com keeps a watch on issues related to it. One of its report highlighted the pollution in Indian rivers: many parts of the Hindu faith revolve around the Ganges River, who they believe is the form of the goddess Mother Ganga on Earth. Because of this, many people’s bodies and ashes are placed in the river. Large amounts of ashes from crematoriums along the Ganges River in Varanasi are dumped in each year. Majority of Hindus are cremated and placed in the river after being burned by Dalits along the ghats leading into their goddess’ body. These ashes are keeping the river from being clean.\n\nDead bodies are also a huge pollutant to the already dirty water, with 35,000 bodies estimated to be discarded into the river,yearly. This is huge amount of dead people to be floating in an important source of water for millions of people. Many times, international observers have pointed out to the Indian government to take effective measures for respect of human remains as pictures of human bodies floating in the Ganges River surface almost every month.\n\nOther than air pollution, poor sanitation, filthy rivers and water contamination, India stands tall in noise population as well.A LiveMintreport on noise pollution in India describes an alarming picture.\n\nThe red light at a traffic junction is the universal sign for vehicles to stop — but in India, it is also a signal to start something else: relentless honking. When noise from constant honking is added to the general cacophony in cities, it becomes noise pollution — and this pollution can be costly and dangerous too.\n\nKnops.co conducts regular surveys of noise pollution across the globe. Its 2018 report puts India in the top noise polluted countries in the world. The Worldwide Hearing Index was created some time ago by digital hearing app founders, Mimi Hearing Technologies GmbH. They analysed the hearing test results of 200,000 of their users. They combined their results with data on noise pollution from WHO and SINTEF, a Norwegian-based research organisation, and used it to plot noise pollution in 50 different cities. The top five cities with the worst noise pollution include Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nTo conclude, President Trump may have casually mentioned ‘filthy India’, referring to environmental issues without much attention to research and scientific evidence, but he has been proven right. India tops the list of the most polluted countries in the world in sanitation, water, air, hygiene and even noise.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2182545-adeelanaureennew-1584984008.jpg"}, {"headline": "Why we need fear for effective disaster risk reduction", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2268212/why-we-need-fear-for-effective-disaster-risk-reduction", "date_published": "Tue, 13 Oct 20 13:18:35 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tToday is the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and living in a time of a global pandemic, the need to prioritise disaster risk reduction has become resounding and all too very real as almost every person and community is suffering from institutional and socio-economic lack of preparedness. \n\nPandemics are not new.

In total, about 85,000 people died, another 140,000 injured and 3.5 million became homeless as 0.6 million houses were severely damaged.\n\nPakistan’s north was particularly devastated and Balakot, the epicentre, was destroyed in a matter of seconds and 15 years on is still struggling to re-build infrastructure and lives. There is hardly any significant rehabilitation or reconstruction. Rather, the funds that were allotted for Balakot’s rehabilitation have been redistributed to the Benazir Income Support Programme(BISP) and Covid-19 Emergency Fund. This speaks to how ill-prepared our DRR is, that funds for one disaster are siphoned for others.\n\nDRR is an incredibly lofty goal for a country that cannot rehabilitate its citizens from disasters that took place almost two decades ago. Pakistan is not the only country unable to learn from past mistakes and lack of preparedness. As stated above, the US, and rather most countries during the Covid-19 pandemic have proven the amnesia that collectively surrounds us when it comes to the destruction of disasters.\n\nDanish philosopherSørenKierkegaard makes a distinction between the concept of dread and fear calling attention to fear as having an object, a definable threat that we can identify. Whereas, dread is a response shrouded in unknowns, is speculative, not belonging to parameters or definitions. \n\nWe are unequivocally living in a global time of fear. We fear the coronavirus, we fear loss of jobs, lives, travel, routine, any semblance to the “old normal”. Our fear is driving conversations and changes around the “Great Reset”: how can this disaster be learned from in such a way that we build back the world, better?\n\nWhat can be changed about the status quo that protects citizens beyond economic and political interests? \n\nHow can this ‘new’normal truly be transformative and inclusive?\n\nFear’s object allows for these conversations to have actionable points and attainable goals. Fear makes having a game-plan easier. Fear divides people into groups of: ‘part of the solution’ or ‘part of the problem,’ as is evidenced by corona-shaming of non-mask wearers and political leaders who had to retract fake news and disinformation.\n\nDRR for objects of fear, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, is timely and due to its global nature, which unlike Ebola which was predominantly contained within the context of “poor” countries, Covid-19’s fear is ubiquitous and has spread to contexts that are not used to suffering —‘developing country’ailments. The politics of fear is also always at play. Who is fearful,who is bearing the brunt of the threat is always imperative. Thus, DRR for infectious diseases is at the forefront of the priority list and perhaps, rightly so.\n\nDread on the other hand, is objectless, casting anxiety far and wide without aim and thus, is much more insurmountable than fear. Many of us dread climate change in an abstract way. We hear the news of sea levels rising. We notice the irregularities of the seasons. We breathe in toxic air like it is a non-negotiable aspect of nature. We watch gut-wrenching clips of starving farmers and drowning residents. \n\nOften though these realities are not directly our own. The dread and threat of climate change is still far away, neatly tucked away somewhere in the future. This is why business-as-usual is the state of affairs when it comes to the economy, government, consumer behaviour and social order. \n\nDRR for dread does not have the same timely impact as DRR for fear.\n\nUnlike DRR for infectious diseases, DRR for climate change is failing to account for human, social and political disaster amnesia.\n\nWhen dread turns to fear, as one may have experienced during the recent floods that engulfed Karachi and other parts of the country, there is suddenly an actionable sensibility that grips citizens and governments alike. Especially when those citizens were elites and urbane. The problem solving caps come on as people are united against a common threat.\n\nHowever, as human populations have made unprecedented exponential advancements in the last three decades, the myriad of threats have also of course, multiplied. Existential threats such as Artificial Intelligence, climate change, cyber warfare, pandemics, to name a few, have caused mounting existential dread invariably leading to inertia of sorts.\n\nI guess the trillion dollar question is: how do we capture what we know about the difference between fearand dread to formulate and implement DRR that works with the psychology and sociology of communities and countries?\n\nThis year, the theme of the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction is governance which is defined as the measure by which“lives are saved, reduced numbers of disaster-affected people and reduced economic losses. Covid-19 and the climate emergency are telling us that we need a clear vision, plans and competent, empowered institutions acting on scientific evidence for the public good.”\n\nUnfortunately, we are all still enveloped in a fear-centric mode of thinking when it comes to DRR. For instance, Prime Minister Imran Khan has recently approved the construction of high-rise buildings in Islamabad. This is problematic for several reasons from a DRR and urban planning perspective.\n\nFirstly, contrary to popular opinion, high-rises are not green solutions. In fact, high-rises encourage vehicular clutter causing serious damage to both environment and humans alike, by increasing air pollution. Vertical urban sprawl wreaks havoc on air quality. \n\nSecondly, high-rise buildings are energy-intensive as glass is simply not very good at keeping excessive heat out, or desirable heat in. Even with technological advancement, the amount of power it takes to keep high-rises going poses a huge opportunity cost to greener solutions. \n\nLastly, Pakistan has many seismic zones and as many high-rises are vulnerable to earthquakes and not always structurally sound, the proliferation of high-rises in the country can pose mammoth near-future risks. Furthermore, high-rises, pose evacuation concerns. If you live or work in a high-rise apartment, you'll face a harder challenge trying to evacuate due to emergencies, such as natural disasters or fire.\n\nIt is said, “earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings do,” which begs the question why is our government taking urban planning measures that are increasing disaster risks rather than reducing them?\n\nOur Prime Minister has repeatedly said, “ghabrana nahi hai (don’t get scared)”; but, when it comes to disaster risk reduction, it would be very wise to be fearful.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Mavra-Bari1602595736-0/Mavra-Bari1602595736-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Public complaints", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2265484/public-complaints", "date_published": "Thu, 24 Sep 20 19:06:54 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn order to further facilitate the public and speed up redressal of their grievances, the government plans to link up all complaint management systems of federal ministries with the Pakistan Citizen Portal. Prime Minister Imran Khan recently issued instructions in this regard. All existing 33 complaint cells of federal ministries will be connected with the centralised complaint system. The PM’s Performance Delivery Unit (PMDU) will decide the modalities in consultation with relevant institutions and devise integration plans. The PMDU has been asked to complete the process within 60 days. The idea is to avoid delays resulting from a multiplicity of complaint cells and duplication of efforts thereby undertaking the process of complaint rectification on a fast track basis. This will also save time and resources. The purpose is to put in place a universal system with many-faceted connectivity features for a comprehensive global grievance redressal mechanism.\n\nThe centralised system will help citizens avoid confusion as now a number of complaint cells are functioning causing problems to both the people and government functionaries working for redressal of public grievances. The integrated system will help eliminate the delays involved in manual processing of complaints. It will bring the whole process of receipt, processing, and removal of complaints under one window, and help citizens get information about the status of their complaints and things related to them. The PCP started functioning as part of the PMDU from October 2018. During the past two years, as many as 28 million people have registered 115,000 complaints, on average, every month, with it. According to official figures, 2.2 million complaints have been resolved with 40% confirmed satisfaction. The rural population might not be getting the facility of the online PCP because of the unavailability of internet services in villages and small towns. This needs to be rectified.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, September 25th, 2020.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "Jodhpur killing", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2265483/jodhpur-killing", "date_published": "Thu, 24 Sep 20 19:06:21 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistani Hindus have begun protesting against the Jodhpur incident as well as the hardships faced by members of the minority community that migrated to India in search of a better life. The false dreams that many of them have are regularly shattered by the harsh reality of India’s still-strong caste system, which rarely allows lower-caste Hindus to rise. Many of the Pakistani Hindu migrants are from those lower castes. For this, they often end up having to wait for decades to be allowed to become citizens of a country that claims to welcome all Hindus.\n\nPakistan Hindu Council Patron-In-Chief Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani made a much more explosive claim that Indian intelligence agencies have been forcing Pakistani Hindu migrants and tourists to speak against Pakistan and even killing people who refuse to do so. As evidence, Vankwani referred to the last month’s case of 11 members of a family who died under mysterious circumstances in the Indian city of Jodhpur in Rajasthan. The family had moved there years ago, motivated by those same false promises of a better life in India. Instead, they ended up being poisoned in their home.\n\nThe case itself is interesting for the secretive manner in which India has acted. The family of subsistence farmers was clearly not spies, yet India has refused to share any investigation details with Pakistan or allowed access to the survivors, even though they all were still Pakistani citizens at the time they died.\n\nVankwani implied that this was because a surviving family member had nominated the RSS and the ruling BJP in the police report. He also noted that no arrests had been made in the case which is extremely concerning.\n\nAfter decades of throwing accusations about the treatment of Hindus in neighbouring Muslim countries, India has shown that it is just as dangerous.

However, while many of the more prominent voices making those calls may appear to have a direct stake in the game — such as the PTI’s political rivals — the truth is that rumours have surrounded the finances of most other major political parties as well. Contrast that with political activists and others who have been calling for reforms for decades, yet have been largely ignored by the powers that be. \n\nClean elections and good governance should not be partisan issues. Unfortunately, failure to update election and political financing laws, or even enforce existing ones, is a collective failure of the political parties and the bureaucracy because it deprives citizens of their basic rights, while also ensuring that truly independent candidates from middle-class or poor backgrounds just can’t compete with the big guns. But maybe that is the point — securing the positions of the ruling elite while also ensuring that they stay in line. \n\nOver the weekend, open government and election transparency advocates at the Free and Fair Election Network , or Fafen, also brought up how political parties inside and outside the parliament need to strengthen regulations to limit the ability of big spenders to virtually buy elections, warning that free-spending without consequences deprives citizens of the right to contest elections and skews results towards big spenders, regardless of whether they are backed by billionaires or smaller, individual donors. \n\nThe weaknesses in the system begin with the current iteration of the law governing elections — the Elections Act of 2017. The act is astoundingly weak in its grants of regulatory power, and can be directly blamed — along with its authors — for allowing the 2018 general election to turn into the biggest spending polling cycles in the country’s history, even when inflation is taken into account. Bye-elections and local bodies polls conducted since then have also seen unprecedented spending, effectively consolidating power among the ultra-rich, whether directly as candidates or through the political parties they bankroll. Strongly enforced spending caps can be problematic in bigger constituencies and areas with higher advertising costs, but they are still probably the easiest place to start. \n\nDonor transparency is another area which needs to be investigated. This could be done through a public database which parties and candidates must regularly update with every political donation received and details of how funds are spent. The same would also apply to private groups and individuals financing political campaigns. Criminal penalties, as long as they are fairly applied, would be more than enough to change the face of Pakistani electioneering, certainly making it cleaner and, hopefully, a little more representative.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 11th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "PDM fiddles while the economy burns", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369873/pdm-fiddles-while-the-economy-burns", "date_published": "Sat, 06 Aug 22 18:44:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe only thing seesawing faster than the Pakistani rupee right now is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s political capital. So, here’s a contrarian take on what’s happening to the Pakistani economy. The real crisis is one of confidence, and not just economic fundamentals. Consider this: Pakistan faced a similar economic crisis at the beginning of PTI’s term and then again at the beginning of Covid-19. In both cases, stability and economic growth were restored. In fact, unlike most countries where public debt rose significantly during Covid-19, we were able to reduce our public debt-to-GDP ratio by about five percentage points through Covid-19. So, why does this economic crisis feel like the end of the world?\n\nThe underlying crisis of confidence this time is rooted in politics versus economics. Let’s unpack the previous economic crisis Pakistan overcame to contextualise this one better. To simplify, PTI’s core challenge in 2018 was inheriting an unsustainable current account deficit with the country standing on the brink of dollar default, while PML-N’s core challenge was to reverse fuel subsidies. The first two years of PTI’s government were hard for our economy because PML-N gave an ailing economy to Asad Umar. \n\nThe primary challenge was a current account deficit of $20 billion thanks to Dar’s fixation on keeping the rupee artificially overvalued versus the dollar. An artificially high rupee meant it was cheaper to import things than to produce them in Pakistan or export goods. Hence, our industry hollowed out, exports declined during PML-N’s tenure and imports we couldn’t afford thrived, bringing us to the verge of bankruptcy when PTI took over. \n\nPTI took politically unpopular but wise decisions to correct these sins, including the painful devaluation of the currency. The idea was they would rescue the economy first, then stabilise and then put it on the growth path. Halfway through stabilisation, Covid-19 hit. Despite Covid-19 though, Pakistan clocked in growth at over 5% over the last two years. This was so good that PML-N argued last year that the numbers had been fudged by the PTI government, only to validate growth numbers this year after over-throwing the PTI government. PML-N even used these healthy growth numbers to secure the latest IMF deal. \n\nHowever, when the PML-N was strategising to overthrow PTI through a vote of no confidence, their primary argument was that PTI was mismanaging the economy and a competent team was needed to restore order. Four months later, we are experiencing the fruits of labour from team competence, with the rupee nosediving and inflation skyrocketing. \n\nIn a provocative recent column, former State Bank Governor, Raza Baqir asks why this crisis feels more dramatic when the economic fundamentals are actually better than before: ‘Given that we successfully restored stability and growth in the recent two challenging crises, why is there not a shared sense of calm confidence that we should be able to do the same this time round? This question is particularly relevant because our reserves and public debt are better today than they were in the 2019 balance-of-payments crisis before the start of the IMF programme. At end-June 2019, our gross reserves had dipped to around $7bn; at end-June 2022 they were around $10bn.’\n\nHe goes on to argue about the central role politics is playing in this crisis. And the next logical question to ask is what is the core driver of the political instability in the country today? The answer to that question is simple, the vote of no confidence against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The irony is that while PDM brought a no-confidence motion against Imran Khan, it’s the Pakistani economy that’s expressing no confidence in the PDM government today. If there’s one lesson everyone can learn from this train wreck, it’s that civilian Prime Ministers should be allowed to complete their five-year terms for both political and economic stability.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 7th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131.JPG"}, {"headline": "Afghan humanitarian crisis", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369656/afghan-humanitarian-crisis", "date_published": "Fri, 05 Aug 22 18:34:35 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfghanistan has a long history of destruction and suffering, be it man-inflicted or natural. Since the Russian invasion in December 1979, Afghanistan has become a battleground of world superpowers and is surrounded by an unending wave of destruction.\n\nAfter the foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan, Pakistan hosted an exclusive Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference to discuss the Afghanistan issue. The conference focused on the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and exploring new avenues to address the rapidly worsening humanitarian situation in terms of food shortage and potential economic collapse. Foreign ministers of member countries, special invitees from the United Nations (UN), international financial institutions, and non-member states, including the US, UK, European Union, and Russia attended the session. Afghanistan’s delegation was headed by the acting foreign minister.\n\nPakistan’s initiative to host the 17th session of the emergency meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the OIC demonstrated Pakistan’s strong will to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan. All member countries unanimously agreed that peace and stability in the region can only be achieved by forming a broad-based and inclusive government that is representative of the entire Afghan society. \n\nDecades of conflict and instability in Afghanistan have left millions of people on the brink of starvation. Some 24 million Afghans were already in need of humanitarian assistance because of the economic crisis and lack of development aid. The situation was further exacerbated after the recent earthquake in Paktia and Khost, which left nearly 1,500 dead and many more injured. \n\nFollowing the earthquake, the Afghan government appealed for international support to address the crisis. The Pakistani government responded immediately by dispatching consignments of relief goods. On 22nd June, the first convoy of 8 trucks carrying tents, tarpaulin, and blankets from the National Disaster Management Authority reached Afghanistan. On 24th June, another consignment of relief assistance was sent through aircraft. Besides this, Pak-Afghan Cooperation Forum (PACF) also sent 5 trucks carrying 37.5 tons of food, winter bedding, tents, tarpaulins, and clothes. \n\nEarlier, PACF had also organised free eye camps in the hospitals in Kabul and Khost where thousands of Afghan patients were provided free treatment by Pakistani doctors. The forum also facilitated the first batch of Afghan children with congenital diseases who will receive free medical treatment in Pakistan. \n\nTo promote bilateral trade with Afghanistan, the Pakistani government decided to relax the visa policy to ensure long-term and sustainable trade between the two countries. Under the new policy, six months of multiple entry visas will be issued to transporters from Afghanistan. Pakistan has also decided to import coal from Afghanistan, which can help Pakistan generate cheaper electricity and save nearly $2.3 billion. \n\nSince August 2021, the economic crisis and collapse of the banking sector have made it extremely challenging to get money into Afghanistan. International humanitarian organisations and the UN have scaled up assistance to address rising needs, but aid cannot replace the services of the state. To institutionalise financial support, a trust fund was established at the OIC conference. However, the international community remains reluctant to allow cash inflow.\n\nDuring this difficult time, the international community must lift sanctions and release Afghan funds as the country has descended into a serious economic crisis. The international community must realise that this is not the time to settle scores or debate on issues of legitimacy or recognition. They must resume aid and support the Afghan people to mitigate their miseries. \n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 6th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Javed-Iqbal1659724580-1/Javed-Iqbal1659724580-1.jpg"}, {"headline": "Dialogue urged to end political uncertainty", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369231/dialogue-urged-to-end-political-uncertainty", "date_published": "Wed, 03 Aug 22 07:47:41 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tChief of Qaumi Watan Party (QWP), Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao on Tuesday while showing concern over current political state of affairs, suggested a grand dialogue for all political par-\nties to ease the situation.\n\nTalking to media persons, Aftab Sherpao said if a grand dialogue among political entities was not held, it would be harmful for the country and its economy.\n\nSuggesting two resolutions to end wrangling between the political parties, Sherpao said in politics the doors of negotiations and dialogue were never kept closed.\n\nHe said if Hasina Wajid and Khaleda Zia could sit on one table in Bangladesh for the sake of their country, then why the government and opposition in Pakistan cannot have reconciliation dialogue.\n\nHe said the political mercury which has touched the new heights of confrontation needed to be brought down through talks.\n\nThe confronting politics, he said, have also badly hit the country’s economy that was a matter of great concern and must be understood by the politicians.

Recently, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the Padma Bridge and declared it a ‘symbol of pride and capacity’. As early as 1992, Sheikh Hasina was involved in the economic issues and plans for Bangladesh. She undertook the task of balancing economic policies with political implications. Sheikh Hasina shifted focus from her father’s socialist agenda toward market-based capitalist growth. She learnt from other Asian countries whose economic success was based upon four pillars: political stability, social development, trade liberalisation with export-led growth and fiscal restraint.\n\nDuring a conference, when an economist began informing her about the benefits of trade liberalisation, Sheikh Hasina quipped, “you don’t have to convince me about trade liberalisation. When I was living with my physicist husband in the Italian city of Trieste on the Yugoslavian border, I watched the border being opened three times a week and people travelling across from both sides, purchasing goods and return.” This demonstrates that Sheikh Hasina was assiduously focused on economics rather than other considerations that politicians are attracted to. \n\nEven though between 1971 to 2009, Bangladesh had hiccups in accountability campaigns and military rule, since 2009, the army has taken the back seat. Bangladesh has seen less frequent derailment of civilian governments and experienced little legitimisation and delegitimization of governments. Although its democratic history is not untainted, Bangladesh’s government has largely avoided public criticism about corruption and inefficiency. Despite having little experience in governance, the Prime Minister possessed visionary acuity and conviction that economic progress was the only way to alleviate poverty in the country. \n\nAlthough marred by allegations of coercion of opponents, after over fifteen years of sustained growth, Bangladesh has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Back in 1970, the country was 75% poorer compared to Pakistan but now it is 45% richer. In 1970, it had 10 million more mouths to feed but now its population is 170 million compared to Pakistan’s 230 million. In 2021, Bangladesh’s exports were $47 billion while Pakistan’s exports were $28 billion. The income per capita in Bangladesh is $2,227 compared to Pakistan’s $1,543. In 2022, its gross domestic product (GDP) is $411 billion compared to the $347 billion in Pakistan. The annual inflation rate is 6% compared to Pakistan’s previous 12-15%, which has now risen to 21% and is expected to further increase. Also, the Bangladeshi taka is much stronger compared to the Pakistani rupee. Importantly, Bangladesh has a strong literacy rate with high female participation in the economy.\n\nIn Pakistan, political parties have remained interested in personal gains. The repeated manipulation of the democratic process has stymied the growth of strong, democratic, and non-dynastic parties. It is worth recognising that economic growth is closely tied with political stability, rule of law, strong civilian institutions, and participatory democracy. Pakistan inherited an overdeveloped state with a feeble bourgeoise linked in a patron-client relationship with a powerful state. The country has inevitably witnessed an economic and political evolution marked by privilege and patronage. Agriculture and business incomes are primarily excluded from the tax net. There is an absence of progressive wealth tax and huge industrial and estate complexes are exempt from any levies. Our parliament is dominated by landlords, it is a small wonder that agriculture income tax has been relegated as an inconsequential subject to the provincial domain. Consequently, the tax net remains small as agriculture and industrial sectors are undertaxed.\n\nSince 1958, all experiments with the government have augmented feudal power instead of empowering the masses. The growth path pursued in Pakistan has been skewed in favour of the privileged, rich, and elite who must now make their fair contribution to the state. \n\nFollowing Bangladesh’s example, Pakistani leadership must pursue economic growth as the national agenda and adopt constitutionalism along with regional peace. Without compromising viable defence, adequate resources must be released for social and economic development. Considering that regional avenues of growth necessitate trade liberalisation, foreign trade agreements must be formed with India, Iran, China, Afghanistan, and other trading partners. Also, the export-led growth model should refocus on high-value-added goods.\n\nPakistan enjoys a comparative advantage in cheaper labour, which must be transformed to improve skills and productivity. Education and technical training for women must be promoted and adopted widely to increase women’s participation in the workforce. Also, a safe and legally conducive environment is crucial for foreign investments. \n\nA serious effort is required to levy a fair tax on agricultural incomes and the rich industrial cartels must make their due contribution to national wealth. Besides wealth and death taxes, large corporate and estate sectors need to be brought into the tax net.\n\nPakistan’s leadership can learn many lessons from Bangladesh’s experience, but the main takeaway should be that Sheikh Hasina prioritised economic growth, which is crucial for both defence and democracy.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 2nd, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Sahibzada-Riaz-Noor1655837455-1/Sahibzada-Riaz-Noor1655837455-1.jpg"}, {"headline": "A stitch in time", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368349/a-stitch-in-time", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Jul 22 19:56:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhen Imran Khan first came to power, he repeatedly lamented the insufficient political space to pursue his promised agenda. PTI was new to governance and struggled to find direction. This found comparisons with other governance models mostly bordering on unchecked power and singular control. The closest we come to it in a democracy is the presidential form but it sits against the ethos of a parliamentary governance model — more popularly accepted given our peculiar political environment. Legislation and parliamentary support for substantial reform stood unattended and PTI’s agenda remained undelivered. That was the moment to return to the electorate for a new mandate through a snap, mid-term or early election. He dithered and stalled till the chips fell. And then it was too late.\n\nToday the nation and the state is at a cross-road and most paths lead out to further disaster than seen in the last six months. It may be politics to those engaged in it but it spells life and death for a nation. There hasn’t been a more precarious moment in our national history. Politics, so used to arbitration, isn’t finding one at the moment — so controversial have the traditional points of mediation turned. The army and its leadership was maligned at will for the most part of the last six years. Any insinuation of the army’s leadership amounts to deliberate subversion, sedition and disruption in the military order. It is now a daily fodder. That the military politicised itself so much as to be a fair game is something for it to ponder over and deal with; but in a country where institutions have had to lend a hand in governance, their need to arbitrate when politicians feud will never go away. With such malicious and vicious attacks on it, the military has been literally neutralised.\n\nMaking courts controversial is the next ploy. The focus is on subverting the judiciary in public non-cooperation to contrive decisions of a side’s liking. A political system’s inability to resolve its own predicaments means that courts are asked to arbitrate. They are then framed for activism and judicial coups in public narrative when decisions don’t go their way. This is patent blackmail. In an environment where the economy is on the verge of crashing, if not already crashed, the threat of a default looms, 120 million people of Punjab have been without a functioning government for the last four months at the hands of political shenanigan-ism, the military is fighting a rear-guard action against terrorism in its midst, and the international environment is tenuous, fragile and laden against us politically and economically, governance is a non-functioning entity while politics is at best fratricidal and predatory. Those responsible for each of these, fiddle instead in crass opportunistic entanglement. There isn’t an institution left that has not been tarnished. So complete is the insinuation and slander. The crisis meanwhile only deepens and engorges us from all sides.\n\nThere are four possible ways-out from the current predicament:\n\n1) There can be a reset of the entire thing as has been the traditional resort when the army intervened and installed a transitional government after it had stalled into inaction. It has always left serious negative consequences to politics and governance in the country and skewed the balance of power unfairly. In the army itself the effects are substantively adverse and distasteful to its own professional culture. It is best avoided.\n\n2) The courts may declare a state of mis-governance in the country and an absence of a government that strictly conforms to the legal, constitutional and moral mandate to claim power. It may then emplace a national government composed of both political and non-political technocrats to fill-in for a period of 6 months to a year to reform and reset what has become broken in the normal course of things resulting in political stagnation. Historically, political classes have manipulated constitutional and legal statutes in their favour. Politics has also tended to corrupt the judicial system through inducement or fear of retribution or manipulation through parliamentary power to proverbially cut the wings of what is perceived a largely independent judiciary — a sine qua non in a democratic state. This option may seem appealing given our state of disorder and institutional break-down, though political parties for the most part will play spoilers to this arrangement by disassociating and disowning the reform process. Arbitrating structures must find a way to engage with political structures to make them a willing part of the process. A constitutional protection will be needed to safeguard any statutory recourse for making governance more sustainable and consistent.\n\n3) The third option is the Sri Lankan way. When the control of the government and its capacity to govern melted away, the only remaining power was that of the people on the streets. Law enforcement agencies could only do so much in the initial stages of the uprising but as soon as it got bigger and voluminous, law enforcement drew back to avoid bloodshed against its own citizens. The option engenders anarchy and chaos, and fragments a nation’s and a society’s core ethos as well as its physical and structural pillars. A nation may then dissolve and a state may cease to exist. In a nuclear-capable nation, it remains unthinkable and will invite intervention, even external. Although Imran Khan has waved this bogey often in a hope to elicit institutional support in favour of his political objectives, it remains a red-flag event needing constant monitoring. Khan has been very poorly and insidiously advised to use this option as a ploy. We have enough political and moral acumen in the country to save us from such a disastrous consequence.\n\n4) Our polity, so used to external arbitration, perhaps needs it the most in current times. It stands dysfunctional and polarised to the point of rupture. Seemingly there exists little possibility for political players to come together in consensus on critical issues. Such is the intensity and depth of the divide. Yet it remains the only saviour out of our debilitating predicament. The President, the army, and the judiciary will need to come together at this precarious moment beyond their respective constitutional domains to avoid a multi-sectoral meltdown of the state and the nation. The agreed mechanism in the 1973 constitution continues to be either subverted or manipulated for political favour, forcing resort to the judiciary for adjudication. Necessary tweaking of laws and statutes may be needed in a consensus to enable sustainable, resilient, transparent and effective governance both at the center and in the provinces. Early elections and a new mandate are essential for a credible government to carry an effective voice with multilateral and bilateral partners.\n\nA half derelict non-concern for a free-falling economy by the government seems more a ploy to keep the powers-that-be interested in rushing the props to keep the government in place. Such purposed neglect is insidious and needs immediate redressal. We cannot sit idly by as negative politics unravels the order. A stitch in time will save us some more.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 29th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Shahzad-Chaudhry1592677757-0/Shahzad-Chaudhry1592677757-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan pulls out of India chess event", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368293/pakistan-pulls-out-of-india-chess-event", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Jul 22 06:50:07 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan have withdrawn from the world's biggest international chess tournament in protest at hosts India holding a torch relay for the event through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Thursday.\n\nThe 44th Chess Olympiad will see over 1,700 players from 188 nations compete in Chennai from now until August 10.\n\nThe last two competitions were played virtually because of the pandemic.\n\nThe Kashmir dispute has weathered decades of violence and upheaval since it was partitioned between India and Pakistan when both countries became independent in 1947.\n\nThe neighbours both claim it in full and have fought two of their three wars over control of the territory.\n\n\"By passing the torch relay through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir...

And yet, the military-industrial complex continues to thrive, elite capture remains elusive, and the juggernaut of divisive politics continues to cause fissures in our cultural zeitgeist. A colossal amount of black money — Pakistan’s illegitimate parallel economy — remains unseen, unreported and untaxed. Whether we are a police officer or a judge, a petty officer or a general, a building contractor or a factory owner, we continue to lie, cheat and defraud others and our country on our way to achieving our goals. Our economy and our morality both are on the cusp of default. As a society, we cannot stoop lower.\n\nIf there is one trait that defines political leadership like none other, it is narcissism. In our frenzied political landscape, knocking at the door of the Supreme Court has become an obsessive-compulsive ritual. If our politicians don’t get what they want, they are quick to approach the highest bench. Regardless of which party they belong to, if the judges rule in their favour, they are hailed as honest and impartial; if the judgements go against them, the same judges are deemed as partial and biased.\n\nOn July 22, a letter was waved once again, this time in the chamber of the Punjab Assembly. This time, it was the Hamza-Elahi face-off. We were back to watching television news shows where uncouth tirades were interrupted by even more uncouth tirades hurled by so-called political pundits. But here is the gist of the problem: legal discussions on the constitutionality of a matter are enlightening, they’re a thing of beauty; but when polluted by partisanship, these same discussions lose their intellectual value.\n\nWhy are politicians so obsessed with hanging on to power? The answer lies in the question itself: power. And this brings me to the power paradox which simply means that we act with empathy and modesty at first but quickly turn to coercion, manipulation and exploitation as soon as we acquire power. Whether we are corporate executives or CEOs, monarchs or political leaders, or even patriarchs in a patriarchal society, the power paradox applies to all of us. Inherent within us is a proclivity for pathological addiction to power, vanity and self-importance.\n\nIs greed a precursor to the power paradox? Is greed the driving force for success? Gordon Grekko, a character played by Michael Douglas in the movie Wall Street, puts it bluntly when he says, “the point is ladies and gentlemen that greed is, for lack of a better word, good.” The fact remains that we are rats in a rat race. Greed feeds our egos. Greed also divides us between the haves and the have-nots, between the exploiters and the exploited. Karl Marx was prophetic about our fate under capitalism: “Money is the universal, self-constituted value of all things. It has therefore robbed the whole world, human as well as natural, of its own values.”\n\nOut of hope or despair, we follow political leaders only to be ushered to the innermost circle of hell. On the one hand, we have political clans that remind us of the Sicilian mafia, the Cosa Nostra. On the other hand, we have a self-aggrandising braggart who shares a passing resemblance with Mussolini. We gather in thousands and listen to them deliver inspiring speeches just like Hitler did about a hundred years ago or Donald Trump more recently. They promise to save our country, to restore our lost glory, our greatness and excellence, while they make secret deals behind closed doors in the dead of the night.\n\nIn Botan Doro, a chilling ghost story, a handsome Japanese samurai falls in love with a beautiful girl carrying a lantern who visits his town every night but disappears before dawn. Smitten with her charm, he chases her down. They begin to spend the nights together. One early morning, the samurai’s nosy neighbour sneaks into his house and finds him dead in his room with his body locked in a tight embrace with a skeleton. The woman was nothing more than a ghost, a seductress.\n\nI wonder if we are all chasing a ghost.\n\n \n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 28th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Dr-Baqar-Hasnain1649437948-0/Dr-Baqar-Hasnain1649437948-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Sanity should prevail", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2367958/sanity-should-prevail", "date_published": "Tue, 26 Jul 22 19:41:28 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe conducts of our political leaders, betraying lack of sense of responsibility and going at any length to stay in power, provide a living example of why nations fail. Not that Pakistan has a history of clean politics but the present crisis especially in Punjab is extremely serious and is taking place when global and regional conditions are pitched against us.\n\nMore consequential is the fact that the country’s economy is in dire straits and the government is desperately seeking IMF and friendly countries to bail it out. Instead of focusing on the best use of scarce resources to satisfy the needs of the people, mismanagement is making matters worse. History seems to be repeating itself as both PTI and the PML-N-led coalition are seeking the support of the army leadership and putting pressure on the judiciary to tilt verdicts in their favour. Whatever tactics the government may employ to stay in power in Punjab and at the Center will only add to the misery of the silent majority, and strengthen the army’s leverage.\n\nImran Khan’s deliberate policy of ignoring democratic institutions and shunning the opposition defies the basic concept of pluralism and tends toward dictatorial instincts. When the entire political energy is geared towards demolishing the opponent instead of presenting oneself as a better candidate or party through performance, the political scenario can turn ugly very quickly. And this situation we are already witnessing. Besides, the prevalent policy of all political parties of blocking programs and initiatives that the previous government had initiated irrespective of country needs has to cease. By such inimical responses the worst affected are the ordinary people. It is unfortunate that the ruling party and the opposition are weakening the political structure and pursuing policies that undermine the economy and lower the image of the country. Moreover, such elite and party polarisation has filtered down at the grass-root level.\n\nIn all the main political parties — PML-N, PTI and PPP — there is excessive concentration of power in the top leadership that is preventing the advantage of making and implementing better policies that would have emerged otherwise from valuable input from the higher tier leadership where sufficient talent and experience resides. Unless political parties do not internally democratise, there is scant hope of improving the quality of democracy at the national, provincial and local levels. Moreover, when political parties have a mix of conservative and liberal, educated and experienced in sufficient numbers, politics of compromise and a certain level of decorum prevails. That seems a long way off and our present challenge is how to reduce the animosity and bitter rivalry among political parties. The flow of dirty money to influence political behaviour has become common place and politicians, instead of enacting laws and taking disciplinary action against the violators, are frequently promoting it. Checks and balances are already in our system but these are largely ignored. We have to work towards the goal to revive these, but to expect that our politicians in their present state of mind would be thinking along these lines would be day-dreaming. Can we also afford to give up and let the country continue to slide?\n\nAdding to our national woes is the adverse international environment. The Russia-US confrontation over Ukraine requires deft handling of foreign relations and the economy in which a better understanding and cooperation of major political parties is necessary. Due to accelerating global inflation and scarcity of basic essentials, especially of fuel, agricultural and industrial products, not only are the prices rapidly increasing but they are frequently becoming scarce. Unfortunately, there is hardly any realisation of these developments that is reflected in the political behaviour.\n\nThe US-China rivalry has also stepped up as President Biden has taken an aggressive posture toward China to dampen its fast-growing economy and influence in the coming years. Apart from its overall negative global fallout, it creates not only economic but also strategic restraints on Pakistan. It would remain a challenge for Pakistan diplomacy to steer this hostile terrain. While remaining steadfast in maintaining a strategic relationship with China, Pakistan should seek close relations with the US in terms of economy and trade. But, here too there is no serious thought being given apart from leaving it to our diplomats. Fortunately, we have highly professional and dedicated diplomats, and presently a competent Foreign Minister that is managing foreign policy astutely under trying conditions. What cannot be overlooked is that Pakistan’s foreign policy would carry weight when Pakistan is internally stable and its economy is strong.\n\nWhat is worrisome is that in this anarchic domestic situation, education, infrastructure, healthcare, and research and development are being ignored with serious consequences for the country’s future. The IT revolution and expansion of globalisation has been only partially absorbed. Leaders struggling for political survival are thinking and planning largely on a short horizon and neglecting these areas. This also has to do with the quality of the power structure and priorities that are driven by special or personal interests. Similarly, how many politicians are listening to the lone voice and warnings of Sherry Rehman on climate change and global warming. Or that of Raza Rabbani, Aitzaz Ahsan on wise political and constitutional issues. Successive government leaderships have been unwilling to open their minds to issues that are long-term, despite the reality that climate change is occurring right here largely due to human activities. There is an urgent need to give serious thought on how to respond to it and should invite interest across the political spectrum.\n\nBut despite the highly disturbing political and economic situation we are experiencing, it can all change provided some sanity among top political leadership prevails. Imran Khan has to lower his rhetoric, take serious issues to parliament and refrain from shaking the frail political structure. And the PDM coalition leadership should avoid political vendetta, take effective measures toward improving governance and lifting the economy while the clock is still ticking.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 27th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1083504-TalatMasoodNew-1460481455/1083504-TalatMasoodNew-1460481455.JPG"}, {"headline": "PM Shehbaz's son in the soup for 'incitement to violence' on Twitter", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2365432/pm-shehbazs-son-in-the-soup-for-incitement-to-violence-on-twitter", "date_published": "Sat, 09 Jul 22 11:12:07 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfter a Twitter account purportedly belonging to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's oldest son --- Suleman Sharif, urged his followers to \"toss shoes\" and \"name and shame\" a family that heckled Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal in a viral video on Friday, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf supporters heavily trolled the businessman's post and called for the account to be blocked for trying to incite violence.\n\n\n\nمیرے شیرو جہاں اس فیملی کو دیکھو۔ جوتے مارو۔ اس گنڈا گرد اور گنڈا لیڈر @ImranKhanPTI اور چورنی پیرنی نظر آئے 🦯 تیار رکھو۔ https://t.co/2srX5PMXJ9\n— Zi Suleman Sharif (@zi_suleman) July 8, 2022\n\n\nIqbal was targeted by PTI supporters as he stood in a queue waiting to place his order in a fast food joint at Bhera Interchange near Punjab's Sargodha.

It’s not expensive and accessible to all people.”\n\nHaider said that the study also indicated that the users had mental health issues. “Methamphetamine or meth negatively affects the mental health of 70.4% of its users. Their family life is disturbed and some of them also lost their jobs.”\n\nThe report also revealed that 54.1% of users of the drug wanted to stop. “Only 17% wanted to continue it because of the efficiency they believed the drug stimulates,” he shared the findings.\n\nAlmost 35% of respondents said during the study that they were raped or sexually assaulted after its use.

In this regard, health officials in Rawalpindi were baffled to detect large number of dengue mosquito larvae at 16,000 different locations — 15,601 houses and 1,000 other localities — during indoor and outdoor surveillance campaigns. This is indeed an alarming revelation which could lead to a deadly outbreak in the near future.\n\nIt is believed that these dengue larvae have been breeding on a large scale during the ongoing monsoon season that saw many places inundated with water. Where there is stagnant water, dengue mosquitoes are bound to increase in number and become a health threat. The district has been carrying out anti-dengue campaigns but unfortunately implementation has been lacking as 99 locations were left out and fake activities were recorded in 377 locations. Officials have taken timely action by registering FIRs, sealing buildings, issuing challans and enforcing dengue SOPs but a systematic action plan must be carried out to destroy breeding grounds before these larvae mature. The ordeal also indicates the importance of draining rainwater in a timely manner. But with many provinces across Pakistan witnessing unprecedented levels of rain, dengue could very well escalate into a national health crisis. This merits attention from the very top.\n\nSurveillance campaigns must be carried out across flood affected areas to identify and destroy breeding grounds. Urban cities must issue dengue SOPs and work towards draining the remaining water left in affected localities. Abandoned buildings along with ponds, pools and other bodies of water in recreational spaces must not be left unchecked. But most importantly, the healthcare sector must be notified and well-equipped to deal with any outbreak.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 19th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "tabiyat.pk joins forces with Hayat Kimya to add quality mother and baby products to its portfolio", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2371800/tabiyatpk-joins-forces-with-hayat-kimya-to-add-quality-mother-and-baby-products-to-its-portfolio", "date_published": "Thu, 18 Aug 22 07:22:34 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\t \n\nIt has been announced that MEDZnMORE's tabiyat.pk has signed an agreement with Hayat Kimya, the fifth largest diaper manufacturer in Pakistan.

The rainy season makes a large number of people susceptible to eye infections as the moisture content in the air creates a favourable condition for bacteria, viruses and other germs to grow and multiply.\n\nAs monsoon rains continue unabated, a large number of people including women and children suffering from eye infections, allergies and conjunctivitis have started making a beeline for hospitals in Garrison City.\n\nOphthalmologists say that allergies and eye infections are a common occurrence during these rainy days as, according to them, the air gets filled with bacteria and viruses. Doctors have advised citizens to take precautions to avoid catching the disease during the current weather conditions.\n\nAccording to Ophthalmologist Dr Tahir Farooq, conjunctivitis is an eye infection that spreads rapidly from one person to another. “Generally, this infection gains momentum in the summer or rainy season. During moist weather conditions, conjunctivitis spreads very rapidly but it can be prevented by taking preventive measures,” he said.\n\nHe said that people must frequently wash hands and avoid hand-to-eye contact to keep eye infections at bay. \n\nThe doctor said that people should avoid rubbing their eyes with fingers as they contain germs and can lead to an infection. He said that people should not share towels, napkins etc as doing so can raise the risk of suffering from eye infections.\n\nNaveed Shams, a patient suffering from conjunctivitis, said that seven out of 11 persons in his house have fallen prey to conjunctivitis.\n\nPatients suffering from the disease feel severe irritation in their eyes and it becomes very difficult to open their eyes in the sunlight. “The patient's eyes become red and water starts discharging from the eyes. I have been visiting the doctor for the last three days, but I did not get any sort of relief,” he said adding that he was following the precautionary measures said by the doctor so that other members of his household would not catch the disease.\n\nAccording to the data obtained from three allied hospitals in Rawalpindi, the number of patients with conjunctivitis has increased in the rainy season as compared to normal days\n\nAs per statistics released by the three allied hospitals, 12 more patients suffering from conjunctivitis have landed in hospitals in the last 24 hours.\n\nEye disease expert Dr Mudassar said that conjunctivitis can also be caused by dust rising after the rain. He said that polluted air and excessive use of fast lighting devices were also the cause of this disease. \n\nHe said that citizens have to show responsibility to prevent the spread of conjunctivitis. He said that the water discharged from the patient's eyes is toxic and when a patient cleans it with his hands, it becomes infected and the disease could be transmitted to other people through shaking hands.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 18th, 2022.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1732991-eyesurgery_reuters-1528782738/1732991-eyesurgery_reuters-1528782738.jpg"}, {"headline": "Two cops killed in attack on polio team in Tank", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2371443/two-cops-killed-in-attack-on-polio-team-in-tank", "date_published": "Tue, 16 Aug 22 08:29:27 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tTwo policemen were killed in an attack on a polio team by armed men on Tuesday in the Tank district of ​​Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).\n\nAccording to the police, constables Pir Rehman and Nisar died in the shooting and their bodies have been shifted to the hospital.

Its share price closed up over 5% on the news on Tuesday.\n\nThe talks come as strained Sino-U.S. relations exacerbate sensitivities over technology transfer and data handling across borders, prompting tech firms to reappraise their operations in China. At the same time, there is growing interest in expanding game-making software to new technologies such as the so-called metaverse, an immersive three-dimensional internet.\n\nUnity entered China in 2012 and its eponymous software, known as a game engine, powers many of the country's most popular games such as \"Honor of Kings\" from gaming leader Tencent Holdings Ltd and miHoYo's \"Genshin Impact\".\n\nRivals include Tencent-backed Epic Games, the U.S. developer of the increasingly popular Unreal Engine 5.\n\nUnity's spin-off plan is being driven by a desire to see its software used more extensively in China in areas as varied as smart city modelling to industrial design, as well as in the metaverse, two of the people said. Potential investors Unity has been speaking to have made big bets on the metaverse, they said.\n\nWith China tightening data handling regulations, Unity believes a spin-off would aid this expansion as it would give the unit more local ownership and autonomy over how it operates in the country, which could also increase its attraction to local government and state-owned partners, the people said.\n\nThe spin-off would be one of China's bigger technology deals this year as investment activity has slowed due to weak economic growth, COVID-19 outbreaks and regulatory tightening.\n\nUnity China Chief Executive Zhang Junbo has been working on the plan for at least a year, two of the people said. Progress has been further slowed by Unity's share price sinking 80% since its November 2021 high amid weakness in U.S. tech stocks, and by a product missing performance expectations, they said.\n\nZhang disclosed Unity's China expansion ambition last month to local tech media outlet 36Kr without mentioning a spin-off, saying Unity was exploring ways to make its technology \"safe and controllable\" within China - a reference to the government's mandate for important technology to be controlled domestically.\n\nHe also said Unity would likely hire over a thousand engineers in coming years while expanding offices in Beijing and Guangzhou in addition to its main office in Shanghai.\n\nTwo of the people said Unity's Shanghai-based employees have been asked to sign contracts with the new entity, and that talks about an operating budget separate to its parent's are ongoing.\n\nA local joint venture (JV) could help Unity \"gain a footing with sensitive industries such as governments and manufacturing that are seeking to modernise their operations with digital twins and real-time 3D enabled technologies,\" said Matthew Kanterman, director of research at Ball Metaverse Research Partners.\n\nWhile forming a China JV carries risk - a notable example being a dispute between British chipmaker Arm and its Chinese unit - Kanterman said such JVs have worked well for many Western tech firms, such as HP Inc and Nokia Oyj.\n\n\"Having the right local partners can help Unity succeed where others struggle,\" Kanterman said.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2166077-gaming-1582884808/2166077-gaming-1582884808.jpg"}, {"headline": "Samsung Galaxy S23 could be the most powerful phone ever", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369816/samsung-galaxy-s23-could-be-the-most-powerful-phone-ever", "date_published": "Sat, 06 Aug 22 07:30:22 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSamsung Galaxy S23 could be the most powerful phone ever once it launches next year.

Cyber-terrorists and state-sponsored hackers are the key actors in cyber-war, who not only attack websites to deface them and steal Facebook accounts, but also compromise and destroy our country's economic security.\n\nA malware agent used in a cyberattack for military, paramilitary, or intelligence purposes is usually referred to as a cyberweapon. Data theft and electronic or physical destruction are examples of cyber weapons. While a cyberweapon nearly always causes direct or indirect financial harm to the target organization, direct financial gain for the sponsor is not the primary goal of this type of agent.\n\nA cyber-army is a group of troops with advanced cyber talents who are extremely competent in information technology. Countries should use cyber-armies to maintain national cybersecurity. China is ranked first in cyber defensive power, followed by the Netherlands and France, then the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the United States leads in cyber offensive, cyber norms influence, and cyber intelligence. Teams at Cyber Command are allocated to specific adversaries — including Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China — and have worked with the intelligence community for years to get access to digital networks. Cyberweapons are stealth weapons that, like any computer code, are written in zeros and ones. They have the ability to infiltrate entire networks as well as infect individual PCs. They have the ability to block communication systems, confound enemy signals, and stop military attacks before they happen, all without the flash and bang of traditional weapons of war.\n\nAlthough cyber warfare is a new phenomenon in its current form, the notion is as old as warfare itself. Rivals used to try to physically interrupt their opponent's communication networks in the old days as well. Similarly, using all available means, well-thought-out strategies were used to gain access to information systems and develop mechanisms of misinformation in enemy ranks.\n\nHumans are becoming increasingly reliant on technology due to rapid advancements in communication tool applications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the efficacy of these technical techniques was put to the test. Even the most advanced states with cutting-edge medical facilities were crippled for months, forcing everyone from executives to administrative staff to work digitally from their homes.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of cyber threats has muddled the internal and external dimensions of national security, allowing less powerful state and non-state actors to increase their influence efforts. One of the causes that have fostered the formation of hybrid threats or made irregular warfare more appealing is the shifting nature of traditional ideas of armed conflict and war, because these may not motivate military action.\n\nDue to its great capacity to disrupt communication infrastructure, cyberwarfare is now regarded as a more appropriate tactic for offensive action against a rival. This is particularly risky because it has the potential to immobilize the target system for the duration of the disruption. Highly sensitive defense installations, such as command and control systems, missile-firing sites, air defense systems, and, more importantly, strategic decision-making mechanisms, may be included in these systems.\n\nThe race for space dominance, which began in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik-I by the then-Soviet Union and ended in 1958 with the launch of the United States' first manned space voyage, was perhaps to attain improved connectedness, integration, and networking in the decades to come. However, knowledge gained via advancements in the fields of information and space technology is now being used in a bad way to disrupt the same communication and integration.\n\nState institutions have become increasingly vulnerable as a result of the use of cyber warfare as part of a strategy to disrupt enemy lines of communication and cause harm to their prospective capabilities. Personal security, which is an important component of human security, is also vulnerable to disruptions in communication, location, and financial activities, to name a few examples. As a result, international and national organizations must establish legal procedures to ensure that cyber warfare does not violate an individual's rights or deprive him or her of his or her financial assets. \n\nCyber-warfare tools used by the military could eventually fall into the hands of hackers. According to Interpol Secretary General Jurgen Stock, in a few years, state-developed cyberweapons will be available on the darknet, a hidden area of the internet that cannot be accessed using search engines like Google.\n\n\"In the physical world, that is a significant problem—we have weapons that are used on the battlefield today and will be utilized by organized crime groups tomorrow. The same is true for digital weapons that are currently in use by the military, have been created by the military, and will be available to criminals tomorrow.\"\n\nRansomware, in which hackers lock down a company's computer systems and demand a ransom payment to regain control, is one of the most common cyberweapons. Cyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nCyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Moscow has been blamed for a number of cyberattacks that occurred before and during its military invasion of Ukraine, but it has always denied the allegations. Meanwhile, Ukraine has solicited the assistance of volunteer hackers from all around the world to aid in its defense against Russian aggression. A \"significant number\" of cyberattacks go unnoticed. \"It's not just law enforcement that demands we develop bridges between our silos, the islands of information,\" says the author. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Cybersecurity Outlook study, the number of cyberattacks worldwide more than doubled in 2021. According to the research, ransomware remains the most common sort of assault, with firms being targeted 270 times each year on average. Critical energy infrastructure and supply lines are being jeopardized by cyberattacks. \n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/top-view-unrecognizable-hacker-performing-cyberatt1659791000-0/top-view-unrecognizable-hacker-performing-cyberatt1659791000-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Future Fest founder Arzish Azam represents Pakistan at BSV Global Blockchain Convention in Dubai", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2359364/future-fest-founder-arzish-azam-represents-pakistan-at-bsv-global-blockchain-convention-in-dubai", "date_published": "Tue, 31 May 22 15:40:56 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfter the success of Future Fest 2022 on May 13-15 in Islamaba, Arzish Azam was invited to represent Pakistan as a speaker at BSV Global Blockchain Convention at Grand Hyatt Dubai held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Saud bin Saqr al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council – Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah.\n\nFuture Fest is the largest tech conference of expo of Pakistan, attended by big web3 companies such as Binance, Epic Games, Kucoin, BitOasis and BSV.

president and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari said on Tuesday that the government and institutions must establish writ of law, otherwise predicting that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan will target and weaken them.\n\nDuring a meeting with PPP ministers and leaders in Karachi, Zadari who has returned to the country after a few days' stay in Dubai, criticised former prime minister Imran Khan for targeting the Pakistan Army and judiciary.\n\n“This man is criticising our army every day,” he said, “while officers and soldiers of the same army are sacrificing their lives in the war against terrorists in two provinces.”\n\n“He threatened the army, police and now a woman magistrate,” the ex-president lamented. \"He is now targeting the judiciary and has threatened a woman judge in Islamabad,” he added.\n\nTwo nights ago, the PTI chairman and deposed prime minister Imran Khan had been booked in a terrorism case on the complaint of Islamabad Saddar Magistrate Ali Javed for threatening the additional sessions judge of the federal capital, Zeba Chaudhry.\n\nA day later, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted former prime minister and PTI Chairman Imran Khan protective bail till August 25.\n\n“He is challenging everyone to arrest him,” said Zardari.\n\nRead  PTI request in Toshakhana reference rejected\n\n“This is not tolerable,” he added as he urged the judiciary to “see if this man is above the law”.\n\n“All institutions must ponder to establish their writ of law lest the law, constitution and institutions fall victim to his lust for power,” he said.\n\n“Since losing power Imran Niazi has lost his temper and his addiction to power is driving him mad with the passage of time,” said Zardari.\n\n“His main focus is to get power again come what may,” he said as he appealed to the judiciary to take notice of Imran’s threats to judges, the ECP and army.\n\n“He is not above the law,” he stated as he inquired “why such a soft corner is being given to him.\" Zardari also said that Imran Khan targeted him, his sister Faryal Talpur, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leaders Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz by sending them to jail.\n\nDuring the meeting, Zardari urged his party ministers and leaders to focus on the rains and flood affectees rather than indulging in politics at this critical time.\n\n“Almost all of Sindh along with the other provinces are reeling from the devastation,” he noted, “so we should focus on rescue and relief activities.”\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url":

Since the enabling expression of “may be released on bail” is used in this part, read with the basic principles of criminal justice, the grant of bail in a non-bailable offence that does not fall within the second part of Section 497(1) CrPC is said to be a rule and refusal an exception.\n\n\"The second part of Section 497(1) CrPC provides that an accused shall not be released on bail if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for ten years. This part of Section 497(1) CrPC which prohibits the grant of bail in certain offences is popularly known as the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\"\n\nHowever, the order said that the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC provides that the court may direct that any person under the age of sixteen years or any woman or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be released on bail.\n\nThe expression “such an offence” used in this proviso refers to the offence mentioned in the second part (prohibitory clause) of Section 497(1) CrPC, as for all other non-bailable offences the court is already empowered to release the accused on bail under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nThe first proviso has thus made equal the power of the court to grant bail in the offences of prohibitory clause alleged against an accused under the age of sixteen years, a woman accused and a sick or infirm accused, to its power under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\n\"This means that in cases of women, etc., as mentioned in the first proviso to Section 497(1), irrespective of the category of the offence, bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as an exception in the same manner as it is granted or refused in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nExceptions\n\nThe apex court also noted that the exceptions for refusing bail in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC are therefore also applicable to the accused who pray for bail under the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC in an offence falling within the prohibitory clause.\n\n“These exceptions are well settled by several judgements of this court. They are the likelihood of the accused: (a) to abscond to escape trial; (b) to tamper with the prosecution evidence or influence the prosecution witnesses to obstruct the course of justice; or (c) to repeat the offence keeping in view his previous criminal record, nature of the offence or the desperate manner in which he has prima facie acted in the commission of the offence.\"\n\nRegarding the case in hand, the bench noted that they do not find any material that would attract any of the above exceptions in order to refuse bail to the present petitioner.\n\n\"We are cognizant of the fact that the persons involved in the commission of offences of robbery or dacoity are usually professional criminals and there is a likelihood that they would repeat the offence if enlarged on bail. But the case of the present petitioner is distinguishable as she was working as a maid in the house of the complainant as per his own version, therefore, she does not appear to be a professional robber or dacoit and we do not find a likelihood of her repeating the offence if released on bail.\"\n\n\"The impugned order passed by the high court is, thus, not sustainable under the law and calls for interference by this Court. This petition is, therefore, converted into appeal and the same is allowed: the impugned order is set aside and the petitioner is admitted to post-arrest bail subject to her furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.\"\n\nThe court also noted that concession of bail may be cancelled by the competent court under Section 497(5) CrPC, if the petitioner misuses it in any manner, including causing a delay in the expeditious conclusion of the trial.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/SC1652779579-0/SC1652779579-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "PTI request in Toshakhana reference rejected", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372689/pti-request-in-toshakhana-reference-rejected", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:39:57 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday rejected PTI’s plea to grant a three-week time to provide documents in the reference seeking disqualification of party chief Imran Khan for not sharing details of Toshakhana gifts, directing it to submit the same within a week.\n\nPTI chief Imran Khan’s counsel Barrister Gohar appeared before the ECP on Monday as a five-member commission headed by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja heard the reference.\n\nBarrister Khalid Ishaq appeared before the bench on behalf of the coalition government while petitioner Mohsin Nawaz Ranjha represented PML-N.\n\nAt the outset of the hearing, the PTI counsel insisted that the party needed at least three weeks to gather and furnish the documents relating to the declaration of assets.\n\n“We are reviewing whether someone has declared iPhone and watches in his assets declaration or not,” the counsel told the bench.\n\nHe further explained that since the ECP had to wrap up the case in three months, the party would rather submit its answer in tandem with another in a similar reference seeking Imran's disqualification.\n\nAt this, the CEC remarked that the PTI would nonetheless still have the documents disclosed in the ECP's report.\n\nHowever, Barrister Gohar Khan contended that PML-N's petitioner Mohsin Nawaz Ranjha should also submit the statements pertaining to his party's declaration of assets.\n\nChiming in, the petitioner replied that the failure of other parties to disclose their assets did not provide Imran Khan \"a licence to his assets\".\n\nThe hearing was then adjourned until August 29.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/ECP1640860350-0/ECP1640860350-0.jpeg"}, {"headline": "Lahore to Quetta train service suspended", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372688/lahore-to-quetta-train-service-suspended", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:39:32 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Pakistan Railways has suspended the train service between Sindh and Balochistan for the next two to three days, as rains and flash floods have inundated railway tracks and damaged bridges, officials said on Monday.\n\n“Our tracks and yards have been affected in Sindh and Balochistan due to heavy rains.

Likewise, when the FIR is registered then the court should also initiate a contempt proceedings or not.\n\nThe Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday decided to initiate contempt proceedings against Imran Khan for passing controversial remarks regarding female sessions court judge Zeba Chaudhry.\n\nAt a rally in Islamabad’s F-9 park on Saturday, Imran had threatened to file cases against Islamabad’s inspector general (IG) of police and deputy inspector general (DIG) of police and declared: “We won’t spare you.” He then warned the judiciary against its “biased” attitude towards his party, saying that it should brace itself for the consequences.\n\nThis is not the first time the court is taking up a contempt matter against Imran. However, the PTI chief has managed to secure relief in such cases.\n\nIn 2013, the top court had summoned cricketer-turned-politician Imran for a contempt hearing over his \"critical and derogatory\" remarks against the judiciary.\n\nImran, who had by then made a major breakthrough in the general election, had allegedly said that the polls were rigged and criticised the judiciary and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not taking notice.\n\n\"While holding press conference on 26.7.2013, he (Khan) stated that the role of judiciary and Election Commission of Pakistan is shameful in the conduct of general elections; that the elections were rigged, due to role played by these two institutions,\" the apex court’s notice read.\n\nHowever, in a major relief for Imran, the Supreme Court decided to drop contempt proceedings on the suggestion of the then attorney general for Pakistan Muneer A Malik.\n\nA three-member bench headed by Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali discharged the notice after hearing the arguments of AGP Munir in the case who said that it is not the matter of disobedience.\n\nThe judgment said that admittedly, Imran Khan is a public figure and duly elected member of the National Assembly who has not only been actively involved in politics for a considerable period, but also heads a political party.\n\n\"In such circumstances, while considering his conduct, we also cannot lose sight of the provision of Articles-19 and 66 of our Constitution, relating to freedom of speech and the privileges of members of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament).”\n\n\"Thus, at this juncture, as a note of caution, we may observe that politicians and other public figures having their say and a following amongst the public are expected to use more decent and guarded language and have to be more careful in the selection of words in public gatherings or press conferences so as to show their intellect, maturity of mind and wisdom qua respect to various national institutions, and to present themselves as role models for the society at large,” the judgement noted.\n\nSimilarly, earlier this year, the Supreme Court refused to initiate contempt proceedings against the PTI chief over the non-implementation of its May 25 order.\n\nThe apex court had issued clear instructions to hold its Azadi March protest near Peshawar Mor between the H-9 and G-9 areas of Islamabad. However, Imran and his protestors did make their way toward D-Chowk, prompting the government to call in the Pakistan Army for the security of the capital's Red Zone.\n\nThe apex court had formed a five-member larger bench, headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, to hear the application filed by Attorney General of Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf.\n\nHowever, SC Judge Justice Yahya Afridi, while dissenting with the majority order, observed that a contempt proceeding should be initiated against PTI chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan for instructing party activists and supporters to proceed toward D-Chowk in violation of the SC's May 25 order.\n\nHe noted that there was sufficient material before the SC to initiate a contempt proceeding against Imran Khan over violation of the May 25 order and instructed the party activists and supporters to proceed toward D-Chowk.\n\nHowever, instead of issuing a contempt notice, the majority judges on June 1 sought reports from director generals of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) as well as Islamabad IG police, interior secretary and others over the alleged involvement of PTI leaders in instigating party workers to reach Islamabad's D-Chowk in violation of its May 25 order.\n\nLater the court was apprised by the law enforcement agencies that a “crowd was organised to enter Red Zone under the PTI leadership who had reached Express Chowk with the intent to proceed further towards D-Chowk as per the directions of the party’s highest command”.\n\nThe matter is still pending in the apex court.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/court-hammer1658069967-0/court-hammer1658069967-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Administrative issues jack up NHA project costs", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372681/administrative-issues-jack-up-nha-project-costs", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:15:58 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe cost of 33 National Highway Authority (NHA) projects has increased from Rs79.5 billion in 2008 to Rs90.73 billion in 2021 due to non-availability of funds and delay in land acquisition.\n\nAccording to the documents available with The Express Tribune, between 2008 and 2021, 33 projects of the authority were completed at cost overruns.

My enthusiasm was further bolstered by the welcome board en route to Makkah which stated “Guests of Ar-Rahman, your safety is our responsibility”.\n\n\n\nOn July 7th, I joined the one million pilgrims – 1.5 million less than in 2019 – in Minna. This was the largest Hajj gathering since the pandemic had forced numbers to 10,000 Muslims in 2020 and 60,000 Muslims in 2021. Suffice to say, all eyes were on the Kingdom. This year’s Hajj also coincided with 100 years of Saudi Arabia’s organising of the annual pilgrimage. Hajj 1443 was made all the more special since it coincided with a Friday, making it Hajj-e-Akbar.\n\n\n\nCompared to my previous experience, the zeal among the pilgrims seemed somewhat diminished. At first, I believed these to be misapprehensions given the reduced numbers. However, increased interaction with my companions made me realise that the pandemic, circumventing all biases, had been hard on everyone regardless of stature. Without a doubt, Covid-19 has broken each and every one of us in some way. The white barrier between the Kabbah and pilgrims was a reinforcing testament to the ‘new normal’ we have all been forced to adopt.\n\n\n\nFrom my past encounters, I was on the lookout for miracles. And I was not disappointed. A friend had related that the people of Makkah claim that clouds provide shade to the Hujjaj. I witnessed this first hand on the Day of Arafat – considered the apex of Hajj – during which unexpected clouds started forming in a previously clear sky, thereby making it tolerable to sit outside in the 44-degree heat. The same happened during the rest of the pilgrimage days. Each ritual reaffirmed what I had grown up hearing: “Hajj sabr ka naam hai” (Hajj is the name of patience), which further reinforces the South African phrase “Umuntu Ngumuntu Ngabantu” (I am because of what we all are). This feeling, I believe now, is a miracle in itself.\n\n\n\nIn line with their Vision 2030, this year, the Kingdom had undertaken many experiments and introduced many changes, with mixed results. A major issue was for those journeying from America, Europe and Australia who had to apply for Hajj using an online portal. There was a lack of clarity in the draw process and mix ups, as a result of which, many people were turned back from the airport.\n\nHowever, this is not to take away from the many improvements I witnessed. In keeping with their national rejuvenation plans, the Saudis had increased the application of modern technology by harnessing the best electronic devices available. This included the “In your languages, we welcome you” campaign, which aims at guiding the pilgrims in 23 languages. This highlighted increased inclusivity and accommodation of pilgrims which I had previously not witnessed.\n\n\n\nA robot introduced in the Grand Mosque, Makkah to distribute Qurans to worshipers.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable sights for me was to see Hajjis zooming along on electric scooters. As a trial service, the Saudi Public Authority for Transport provided pilgrims with this service to help ease the time taken between Holy sites. For instance, the usually one-hour walk between Arafat to Muzdalifah was reduced to just 15 minutes. This is in addition to the Saudi Hajj Ministry’s adoption of smart technologies to help assure comfort of the Hajjis.\n\n\n\nBy the same token, there were visibly increased numbers of security officials and scouts to aid the pilgrims not only during the rituals but also in and around the Holy Mosques. Another marked change was the greater role of the youth in all areas of pilgrim assistance; be it spraying water on the pilgrims to provide relief from the heat or medics and security personnel.\n\nSimilarly, even though on previous visits I had noticed the expanding role of women in workplaces in the country, this time around it was very distinct. Now there were uniformed women officers inside the Mosque, women volunteers at the airport and even women administering passenger data input. These tasks had previously been reserved for men alone.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, after a two year international hiatus, Hajj 1443 was a success and a triumph for the Muslim ummah in the face of the trials and tribulations brought on by the pandemic. Restored, refreshed and recentered, I departed Madina airport, leaving a part of my soul in Makkah and a piece of my heart in the Prophet’s (PBUH) city.\n\n\nAll photos courtesy of the author.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1081507-HajjTawafKaabaAFP-1460156940/1081507-HajjTawafKaabaAFP-1460156940.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan and Iran: The potential for a great alliance", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97602/pakistan-and-iran-the-potential-for-a-great-alliance", "date_published": "Wed, 22 Jun 22 08:36:24 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMarred by sectarian violence, opposing interests, differing foreign policies and failed economic possibilities, Pakistan-Iran relations have soured throughout the years. As a result, Islamabad has seldom explored the possibility of deeper relations with its western neighbour.\n\nAlthough Pakistan and Iran co-operate on a multitude of different platforms and sectors, the degree of cooperation has often been tested, and a considerable amount of blame for this falls on Pakistan’s shoulders. Shackled by its external constraints, primarily in the form of American influence, the risk of Saudi alienation, and the sanctions on Iran, Pakistan has consistently remained reluctant to pursue deeper relations. Iran, on the other hand, has shown a willingness to strengthen bilateral ties, the chief example being the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline. Islamabad’s lack of interest has not gone unnoticed in Tehran.\n\nIndignant about Pakistan’s ambivalent foreign policy, Iran has sought a closer relationship with India, which has proven to be a resourceful and trustworthy partner. In direct competition with Pakistan’s Gwadar port, Indian support helped Iran mobilise Chabahar as a major oceanic port in the region. Furthermore, Indian influence in Iran has helped India to indirectly meet its nefarious interests against Pakistan, particularly vis-a-vis Balochistan and Southern Afghanistan. As a result, Islamabad’s lack of interest in seeking a meaningful relationship with Iran has weakened its overall influence and created a region where Pakistan is becoming increasingly cornered.\n\nHowever, the obstacles which once sought to hinder Pak-Iran relations are now beginning to wither away, paving the way for a potentially great alliance.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Pakistan faces when it comes to Iran is pressure from its ally, the United States (US). America has been explicitly vocal against any form of cooperation between Iran and Pakistan, and it is no secret that it has sabotaged numerous initiatives between the two nations. However, following the war in Ukraine, America has had a change of heart. With the threat of a severe energy crisis inexorably hitting the developed and developing world, America has confronted the situation by re-engaging with countries that it once had vowed to eschew.\n\nIn March 2022, after years of estrangement, a senior American delegation had a rare face-to-face meeting with the Nicolas Maduro government in Caracas, Venezuela, the world’s most oil-rich country. The meeting had a one-point agenda: replace Russian oil with Venezuelan oil. Similar energy-focused engagements with Libya have also been undertaken by the US. More interestingly, the Biden administration has felt the JCPOA agreement (Iran Nuclear Deal) should be revived to relieve Iran of its sanctions and benefit from its abundant gas and oil supplies. Talks in Vienna are already underway and major headway is being made, highlighting the possibility that a deal could once again be struck.\n\nAmerica’s change in position is driven purely out of necessity for its own self-interest; however, with no end in sight in Ukraine, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US is adopting softer attitudes toward its oil-rich adversaries, in particular Iran. For Pakistan, this is a now or never opportunity: capitalise on the west’s relaxation now and secure deals with Iran or delay the opportunity and ultimately face the wrath of the west.\n\nAnother hurdle Pakistan faces when it comes to Iran is the Saudi Arabian question. Any venture with Iran risks the upsetting of ‘brotherly’ Saudi Arabia, and although Pakistan has remained explicitly neutral in the pair’s cold war – through the training, support, and cooperation with its armed forces – it is clear that Islamabad indirectly sides with Riyadh. As a result, Pakistan’s alliance with the Saudis bars it from exploring real terms with Iran.\n\nIn the past year, however, there have been growing signs of rapprochement between the two arch rivals. Through the meditation of Iraq and Oman, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been willing to sit at the peace table and are now engaging in their fifth round of direct talks. Furthermore, with the cessation of hostilities in Yemen as well as the re-opening of the Iranian representative office in the OIC, analysts are hopeful that the two countries are finally coming to some form of an agreement, and the possibility of re-establishing diplomatic missions is not too far fetched.\n\nAs for Pakistani gains in light of such developments, they are significant. Not only can Islamabad now engage peacefully with Tehran, without alienating Saudi Arabia, but it can also facilitate further reconciliation between the two countries and emerge as a key mediator of peace in the region.\n\nWith the roadblocks to cooperation finally lifting, Pakistan and Iran can pave the way for a great alliance. This alliance can take two forms, one of an economic dimension and the other of a non-economic one. However, the beauty of a Pak-Iran alliance is not in its business prospective nor the cultural linkages but in the fact that it is mutually beneficial. At home, both Iran and Pakistan face pressing issues of different kinds, yet both sides can help each other solve their respective problems.\n\nThe major cornerstone of Pak-Iran relations has been the proposed Pakistan-Iran (IP) gas pipeline, a proposition which can mutually benefit both sides simultaneously. Stretching from South Pars all the way to Punjab, the 1900km pipeline would provide inestimable value for both Pakistan and Iran. As it currently stands, however, the IP gas pipeline is an opportunity fading away. Despite the project’s inception nearly a decade ago, the pipeline has yet to even start. Iran’s side of the pipeline is built but has simply been left to rust, while Pakistan’s side is waiting to start construction.\n\nThe causes of Pakistan’s lack of initiative is due to the abovementioned external pressure coupled with internal distrust, leading to the project’s early abandonment. However, this can all change. As stated before, Iran’s rapidly changing geopolitical image, as well as the easing of Pakistani challenges vis-a-vis foreign policy could usher in a new wave of enthusiasm. The IP gas pipeline could finally restart and ultimately benefit the two countries immensely.\n\nPlagued with severe energy shortages, depleting indigenous sources and inchoate industries, Pakistan is on the brink of energy starvation. So far, loans and expensive imports have kept the energy sector afloat, but these are short-term solutions and are unsustainable in the long run. As for local energy sources within the country, they too have proven insufficient.\n\nUltimately, Pakistan will need to increase its imported energy, preferably at cheap and subsidised rates. Once revived, however, the IP gas pipeline can solve the majority of these problems. Providing 22 million cubic metres of gas a day, and electricity generation equivalent to nearly 4,500 megawatts, the pipeline would be able to meet nearly all of Pakistan’s current electricity shortfall. Furthermore, compared to its current import from countries such as Qatar, Iranian LNG is far more affordable.\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, the IP gas pipeline can cement Pak-Iran relations and effectively thwart expanding Indian influence in the region. What’s more interesting is that in 2016, China expressed the desire to invest in the pipeline and expand it into its own borders. Iran welcomed Chinese interest and sweetened the deal by expressing interest in joining the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). If Iran joins, an unparalleled trifecta in the region could emerge, hence promoting development, peace and stability. Although it is too early to tell right now, initial willingness from different countries has shown that the IP gas pipeline could be a catalyst for extraordinary cooperation in the region and beyond.\n\nFor Iran, the IP gas pipeline could provide much-needed relief to its ailing economy. Crippled by years of brutal sanctions, Iran has failed to effectively monetise its abundant oil and gas supplies, and as a result, has suffered from abysmally low GDP figures. Notably absent from LNG and oil markets, Iran is missing out and is eager to establish itself as a force in the economic world. Moreover, Iran has lacked an iron brother-like alliance with any of its neighbours to assist in alleviating its crises. For example, Iraq is embroiled in constant turmoil and lacks stability for any strong alliance to emerge, while neighbours in the Caucasus do not see eye-to-eye with Iran. However, an economic alliance with Pakistan is not only stable and safe, but the market of 220 million people can provide ample opportunity for Iran to fulfil its economic needs.\n\nOver the past decades, an environment of trepidation and apprehension has developed in place of a potentially fraternal relationship between Pakistan and Iran. The two countries have continually looked away from one another, opting to search thousands of miles away for rather unsustainable and short-lived alliances. However, as Pakistan and Iran unshackle themselves from the constraints of geopolitics, they must look towards one another for a better future.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/image1654671439-0/image1654671439-0.png"}, {"headline": "Does gun control even matter to GOP members and the NRA?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97595/does-gun-control-even-matter-to-gop-members-and-the-nra", "date_published": "Tue, 07 Jun 22 11:29:25 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMass shootings are gaining renewed momentum across the United States (US) in light of the Texas school shooting and Memorial Day gun violence in Chicago. The former incident is said to be the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook. These are just a few instances of gun violence that get plastered all over the news, and rightfully so.\n\nAccording to Gun Violence Archive, there have been at least 246 mass shootings in the US so far this year, far more than the number of days passed in 2022. More than 2,000 American teenagers between the ages 12 to 17 have been shot dead or injured this year. There have been 8,346 gun-related deaths, 15,768 injuries and 634 unintentional shootings. Moreover, 473 children between ages zero to 11 years were shot during the first half of this year. What also appears to be gripping parts of the US are imitation mass murders. Following the Memorial Day shootings, there have been 13 others this past weekend, leaving more than a dozen dead and at least 70 injured. Gun violence is an act of terrorism that is encouraging repressed individuals to come forward and commit crimes openly.\n\nIt is critical to consider the complexity of America’s gun violence epidemic. Although mass shooters target innocent civilians at large, people kill in self-defense; they also commit suicide using weapons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2020, 54% of all gun-related deaths in the US were suicides (24,292). Therefore, gun violence should never be equated to mass shootings alone. The issue is more nuanced than we think.\n\nTake for instance the Covid-19 pandemic. It caused 45,000 deaths (suicide or homicide) by guns. These deaths can be partly attributed to loss of jobs, psychological strain and exacerbated mental illness that Americans experienced in 2020.\n\nThat said, gun violence in America continues to take an emotional toll on families, while gun advocates observe in silence. Gun advocacy is a big part of the problem to push for safer, smarter gun control measures. A vocal proponent of guns is Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who signed seven laws, making it easier for people to access guns, including individuals over 21 who can carry a handgun without license and training. Easier access to guns caused gun violence to soar in Texas, which has one of the highest numbers of mass shootings in the US. Last year, Texas saw a 65% increase in mass shootings.\n\nOn top of gun advocates and GOP (republican party) members backing their second amendment rights, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has an equally important role to play in politicising gun control. It is no surprise that the NRA uses funds to push its agenda forward, which is to support guns left-right-centre. They use heaps of money to sway the debate surrounding gun control in their favour. Numerous Republicans⁠, Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, Mitch McConnell, and a dozen others have benefited from the NRA in the past, including a law firm that has backed the association for years in exchange of $23 million.\n\nIn the wake of deadly mass shootings, it is unfathomable that the NRA would hold its annual meeting days after the Robb Elementary School massacre. This insensitive move demonstrates the NRA’s audacity to push for gun rights in a time when thousands of families grieve the loss of their loved ones. The association claims that it is “committed to making schools secure” but it is only in the guise of hypocrisy.\n\nAlthough democrat states including New York and California are making concerted efforts to counter gun violence through bills and gun buyback programs, these efforts will never budge GOP members. Schools, colleges, theaters and bars will continue to be targets of mass shootings because second amendment rights hold more value than human life in Republican states.\n\nSo, where is the middle ground if there is no solution to gun control at all? The key is to keep gun laws intact but changing the eligibility criteria of who qualifies to own a gun. A person with a history of mental illness should never have access to guns. This begs the question: how do you know someone is mentally unfit to own a gun? That is where running thorough background checks comes into play. These background checks can help curb a potential mass shooter from committing mass murder.\n\nIn addition, the legal age to own a gun should be raised from 18 years to at least 21. Right now, individuals 18 and older can be sold long guns, which is alarming given that two 18 year-olds were responsible for the deadliest school shootings in America (Sandy Hook and the recent Robb Elementary School shootings). Countries such as Norway, Canada, New Zealand and Australia managed to curb gun violence through smart gun laws. The rate of mass shootings has sharply declined in these countries. Perhaps the US should extract valuable lessons and parallel similar gun reform strategies, if not exactly the same.\n\nThe media plays a very essential role to get the word about gun control out to the public. If media agencies including digital, print and broadcast, set aside their political differences and harmonise to address gun violence and gun control, things can steer in the right direction. Media coverage of mass shootings across the country can raise more alarm about gun violence in America, which can lead to protests, political pressure and ultimately, some form of resolution.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/OHKOJWUK2FLT7FEKYXS47ABT3I1653551321-0/OHKOJWUK2FLT7FEKYXS47ABT3I1653551321-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Why developing countries should not reduce their reliance on fossil fuels", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97593/why-developing-countries-should-not-reduce-their-reliance-on-fossil-fuels", "date_published": "Fri, 03 Jun 22 09:57:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn just 24 days in 2022, an average American had produced more carbon than an average Pakistani would produce in the whole year. In just three days, an average Australian emits more carbon dioxide than his counterpart would do in the whole year in Niger. The video gaming industry in the United States (US) consumes more electricity than any country in Africa. Of the total 1.5 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere since the middle of the 18th century, 70 per cent has been produced by the US, China, Europe and Russia, with the US being the largest emitter by far. \n\nThese are some of the facts that reflect a wide gap between posturing by the rich countries of the world of being considerate of the environment and the deplorable ground reality.\n\nThe richest countries are home to half of the world’s population and emit 86 per cent of the world’s total carbon dioxide emissions. If we are to improve the climate and limit global heating to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, carbon emissions have to be curbed and more action is required from the rich and developed countries. Many in the developing world are of the opinion that the global north has already benefited from fossil fuels and now that it has all the means and resources to shift to cleaner energy, it is imposing the same on the global south where people are yet to attain a higher standard of living. Critical energy projects for less economically developed countries are being banned under the garb of environmental conservation.\n\nAt the 26th Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) held in 2021, more than 20 countries – including the US and some European nations – pledged to stop foreign fossil fuel financing while giving no indication of curbing their domestic production and expansion. Such two-faced actions do more harm than good: one, by pushing poor countries further to the brink; and two, by making a mockery of environmentalism and snatching away its true spirit and purpose.\n\nIn a similar move, China announced last year that it won’t build new coal-fired power plants abroad. China has been the major contributor to Pakistan’s coal-powered energy sector in the recent past. Pakistan has total coal reserves of more than 185 billion tonnes and ranks seventh among the countries with the largest lignite coal reserves. These reserves can ensure sustainable development by keeping the economic and social pillars of sustainability intact through empowerment, improved well-being and availability of opportunities for the present and future generations.\n\nDepriving the developing world of growth and development by curbing the supply of fossil fuels or by halting investments in fossil-generated energy projects will deteriorate beleaguered economies. It is important that the global south be allowed to follow the same path to development as the global north took, that is, by ensuring development through industrialisation, even if it came through the use of fossil fuels. Economic prosperity will, in fact, enable the availability of necessary resources and capital to protect another pillar of sustainability – the environment. This doesn’t mean that development will necessarily come at the expense of the environment. Environmentally-friendly fuel to energy conversion technologies can be used to mitigate harmful environmental impacts. Instead of curbing the funding of fossil-generated energy projects, the richer countries should invest in the use of less harmful methods of energy generation through fossil fuels.\n\nReadily available and economically viable energy options are the need of the hour for many developing countries like Pakistan, without which the achievement of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will remain a distant dream.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1080201-SmokestackinChinaCarbonemissionsAFPxx-1459978271/1080201-SmokestackinChinaCarbonemissionsAFPxx-1459978271.jpg"}, {"headline": "It’s not about being pro-abortion, it’s about being pro-choice", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97578/its-not-about-being-pro-abortion-its-about-being-pro-choice", "date_published": "Sat, 07 May 22 10:24:08 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSome interesting developments (or lack thereof) have surfaced about the abortion laws in the United States (US). Feminists who fought long and hard for a woman’s right to choose are turning in their graves after discovering that Justice Samuel Alito is considering overturning a landmark decision in the case of Roe v Wade, which sought to protect abortion rights in the US almost 50 years ago. An initial draft of the said move has been leaked. Even though this leaked draft is not the final verdict or opinion of the court, it has however sparked a serious wave of reactions and disappointment from abortion rights advocates. If the final call reflects the opinion draft, America will see a drastic shift regarding abortion rights in the country.\n\nFor anyone not already familiar with the original Roe v Wade, here is a quick description and a somewhat lengthy explanation about its significance for women’s rights. A landmark decision was taken in 1973 by the US Supreme Court that ruled that the Constitution of the US protected women’s liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restrictions. This decision ultimately opened up safe spaces and clinics for women who wished to have abortions done, with services provided by fully trained and licensed physicians. The decision ultimately explained that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution provides “a right to privacy” which protects a pregnant woman’s rights to choose. Furthermore, the court reasoned those outlawing abortions would violate a pregnant woman’s right to privacy for reasons such as:\n\n\n\thaving unwanted children would lead to a distressful life and future for the woman;\n\tit may cause long-term psychological harm which could result in poor care of the child considering the mother’s weak physical and mental health;\n\tand because there may be “distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child”.\n\n\nThe decision was celebrated by abortion rights advocates as this was a huge move towards recognising women’s rights when it came to making their own choices about their bodies. And why shouldn’t it be? The benefits of legalised abortion are plentiful – fewer illegitimate births, smaller welfare costs, less children born as a result of rape. However, according to Alito, the constitution makes no such reference to abortion and that no such right is implicitly protected by the constitutional provision.\n\nTherefore, the overturning of Roe v Wade would lead to stricter limits on abortion access largely in the South and Midwest, with about half of the states set to immediately enforce broad abortion bans. On the other hand, the following 16 states have laws in place to protect the right to abortion: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\n\nWhy this debate is causing such an uproar is not only because this is overall a huge setback for women’s right to choose what they want to do with their bodies but also the deep negative impact the ban will have (if implemented) on women who are prevented from obtaining abortions. Some of these adverse consequences include mental, physical and financial impacts. It has been proven in several studies that being denied an abortion is linked with an increase in anxiety, stress and lower self-esteem shortly after the denial. Women who are denied abortions also experience financial hardship, including an increase in household poverty considering there are additional mouths to feed and there are no strict laws around having the biological father provide child care support.\n\nIf abortion is to be banned and women’s bodies are to be controlled by a bunch of old white men, then perhaps they should also consider the consequences this will have on those very women, especially rape victims who have to carry the child of their abuser for nine months and then live with that trauma forever; while also being at risk of being contacted by the rapist for child custody or continued sexual violence and harassment. The ban would also greatly impact teenage mothers, sex workers and/or those women who become pregnant in cases of premarital and extramarital affairs. The fear of raising the child alone and being financially incapable of raising the child are of the top most reasons of pregnancy termination. Another very common reason for terminating a pregnancy is known as “young age pregnancy”, which ultimately would affect the young girl’s life negatively, while restricting her mobility and opportunities. Why is it that controlling women’s bodies and hindering their bodily autonomy is always up for debate, yet men’s accountability is hardly ever spoken about?\n\nA better draft opinion to read about would’ve been the US Supreme Court leaning towards providing free vasectomies for men. It’s a fairly painless and reversible process which does not cause any kind of long-term psychological or physical ailments. If men who get women pregnant can ‘choose’ not be part of the raising process, they should be encouraged to undergo the medical procedure so as to not cause pregnancies at all. The procedure can be reversed if and when they decide to have children consensually with their partner. But of course, restricting men’s bodily autonomy would be of the utmost disgrace and disrespect.\n\nAccording to Alito’s draft opinion, the idea that the abortion bans reflect the subjugation of women in American society is wrong considering women still have electoral and political power. By this logic, if women possess the right to vote or hold a public position, they should completely give up the right to decide what they want to do with their bodies because a few people who don’t even have a uterus can feel important about themselves. I wonder if these people who have decided to put these rights up for debates in the first place have even researched about the topic at all. It is actually quite obvious that despite the bans on abortions, they will continue to take place, only they will be unsafe and painful ones. Post-abortion care is essential for addressing disabilities caused by induced or self-induced abortions because they can surely be taken care of. However, the likelihood of women having access to post-abortion care and services will be practically zero in the states where the ban is to be implemented.\n\nThe US claims to be a superpower leading the world with its impeccable score on all fronts as a nation, but ironically their conservative ideas around minority rights have always remained questionable. These abortion laws are no different. Abortion is a reality, which is why it is essential that women be provided with affordable and easily accessible services without any pre-conceived notions and biases. The right to choose is a fundamental one and courts should challenge their abortion laws instead of executing bans that are only an attack on women’s freedom. If there is a ban which needs to be implemented immediately it is America’s gun laws which take more lives than abortions, with conviction rates of criminals at a disappointingly low rate, especially if the shooter is described as a white male. Pro-life advocates who are for the ban need to rethink their priorities and direct their energy into making more sensible arguments and fight for the justice of innocent children and adults who have been killed during school hours or in movie theatres by white American men who have the freedom to legally obtain a weapon over the counter, that too without a license or any understandable reason.\n\nThis is not about being pro-abortion, this is about being pro-choice, that no matter what your personal feelings or beliefs about abortion are, you understand it is not your place to make a decision for another woman about what she can and cannot do with her body.\n\nTo know where Pakistan stands on abortion laws, you can read my detailed piece here.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651920521-0/Cover1651920521-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Follow Riasat-e-Medina in Pakistan but not in Medina itself", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97576/follow-riasat-e-medina-in-pakistan-but-not-in-medina-itself", "date_published": "Sat, 30 Apr 22 10:01:34 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tYou know things have truly gone down the drain when local politics in Pakistan is unnecessarily taken out of context, literally, and used as a sorry excuse to spread hatred, ignorance, violence and blatant sexism. In the most recent case of embarrassing and shameful events, supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) went ahead and created complete havoc at Masjid-e-Nabawi without thinking twice about the historical and religious importance of the very ground they stood on.\n\nIn case they forgot, here is a quick reminder: Masjid-e-Nabawi is one of the most sacred places in Medina for Muslims. Considering Pakistanis have self-appointed themselves as the sole protectors of Islam for so long by protecting and defending blasphemy laws in the hope of punishing (even if wrongly) those who apparently disrespect Islam, this very act in Medina has proved that nothing – not even a place of worship during one of the holiest months for Muslims – can stop these devils from showing their true colours.\n\nThere is a nasty video being circulated on social media showing a bunch of men chanting slogans of “chor, chor” (thieves) at some members of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s delegation in Medina. Not only that, it is clearly visible and audible the highly disrespectful and profane language and slogans being hurled at the current Federal Minister of Information and Broadcasting Maryam Aurangzeb. Using disrespectful and disconcerting sexist slogans against women is so outdated but, since a patriarchal induced understanding of gender and culture plagues this country so deeply, this is hardly a surprise. Degrading and violating women has long been used as a tool and indicator of victory in wars, and this, it seems, is no different – especially since Imran Khan keeps comparing this whole political escapade to the battle of Karbala.\n\nThe harassment faced by various members of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) while performing their religious duties has raised eyebrows across the globe as Pakistanis are yet again being highlighted for their deranged actions. The sanctity of the holy mosque has been spoiled and there is no justification for carrying out dirty political agendas on holy sites.\n\nAs if the political garbage that we’re witnessing first-hand in Pakistan wasn’t enough, we are now a mere laughing spectacle for those nations whom we have tried to convince otherwise in the hopes of building amicable relations. As if our perceived association with terrorism wasn’t enough, this has added another feather to our embarrassment cap. If Imran set out to create a Riasat-e-Medina in Pakistan, perhaps he should give sermons to his followers on how to effectively follow the rules of Medina in Medina at the very least. It’s obvious that pre-planning this stunt did not go the way he wished. Sadly, and evidently, this cult mentality has brought politically blinded citizens to a point where they see nothing wrong with what they did. Many have not even bothered to condemn this awful incident, and the rest are still finding ways to justify it.\n\nYes, every citizen of a country should be well-aware and critical of the politics of their country and should be able to question their leaders whenever they see irregularities, injustices and/or discrimination taking place. But to be politically charged to this extent is very dangerous since some Pakistanis will export their violent and extremist attitudes to the countries which have allowed them in, further causing global isolation. These actions are mostly perpetuated by men, and usually women have to pay the price. But alas, when a so-called leader openly supports sexual harassers and believes in victim-shaming, one can hardly expect any wise, well-thought out and grounded decision-making.\n\nI am amazed at how effortlessly all of this has been planned and implemented. This particular incident reeks of misogyny and hypocrisy at all levels. It is obvious that this will destabilise and polarise the nation further, and will make violence an acceptable form of ‘protest’. The common saying “politics can be dirty” is an understatement in the case of Pakistan. Our politics is not only ours, it’s for the entire world to find entertainment in. But, more importantly, it is a disgrace to the religion we hold so dear.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651313943-0/Cover1651313943-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Are we on the brink of a global recession?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97575/are-we-on-the-brink-of-a-global-recession", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Apr 22 08:21:09 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSince Covid-19 brought the world to a halt in 2020, life has been nothing short of a nightmare.

With inflation on the rise, widespread supply chain bottlenecks, and rising geopolitical tensions, governments face a monumental task in steering their countries away from a crisis. Looking at the current global situation, it is clear that we are in deep waters and may be on the verge of a global recession.\n\nWith economies all over the world reopening and consumers returning to markets, the main issue that central banks are dealing with is rising consumer prices. To combat inflation from rising any further, central banks started winding down their quantitative easing measures put in place at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, these measures were rendered ineffective due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which exacerbated global supply chains and drove commodity prices to historic highs, adding fuel to the already raging fire.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict has been detrimental to oil and gas prices, which have risen sharply. Furthermore, the two countries are large exporters of agricultural commodities, and account for nearly 14% of global wheat trade. Similarly, Russia and Ukraine account for nearly 19% of global barley exports and nearly 52% of global sunflower oil exports.\n\nIt is also important to note that, because Russia is a major fertiliser exporter, sanctions against the country could have a negative impact on fertiliser supply around the world, lowering crop yields. Russia is also a major supplier of valuable minerals such as palladium, titanium, nickel, and neon. Palladium, in particular, is a critical component in automobile manufacturing, and its price has increased astronomically since the war began. Supply disruptions in these commodities from Russia and Ukraine have driven up consumer prices even further.\n\nAside from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, China’s zero-Covid policy is causing mayhem in commodity supplies all over the world. The imposition of strict lockdowns and travel restrictions is harming demand and economic growth in the world's second-largest economy. Shanghai, the world’s busiest container port, is closed due to an uptick in coronavirus infections in the region. As a result, hundreds of cargo ships have been stranded in the port.\n\nMoving forward, China's return to a Covid-zero state is highly unlikely given the likelihood of new coronavirus variants emerging in the future. As a result, the global economy is predicted to stay under pressure, at least in the short term, and inflation is expected to continue its upward trend, forcing central banks to continue hiking interest rates until the global macroeconomic outlook stabilises.\n\nConsequently, given the Russia-Ukraine war and the slowing down of China’s economy, policymakers around the world are considering the likelihood of the global economy entering into a recession. According to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the growth of the global economy will drop to 2.8% in 2022. Earlier, it had predicted that the global economy would expand by nearly 4.1% before Russia declared war on Ukraine. Similarly, as per WoodMac, a research and consultancy company, the global economy is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2022 and 0.7% in 2023.\n\nInvestors around the world are already tweaking their strategies and becoming more cautious as uncertainty in global markets continues to rise. This is clear from the inversion of the American Treasury yield curve, which indicates that investors are shifting away from risky equities and towards short-term fixed income bonds in an attempt to protect themselves from the possibility of the global economy slowing down in the short term. Furthermore, fund managers around the world are also increasing the weightage of cash in their portfolios.\n\nConsidering the aforementioned warning signs such as rising inflation, inversion of the American treasury yield curve, and portfolio reallocation by global fund managers, the likelihood of the global economy entering a recession in the short term is high. Hence, countries are at a critical juncture where policymakers must be proactive in dealing with the looming issues, and governments should be actively seeking for ways to protect their respective countries from the implications of a global recession.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651134728-0/Cover1651134728-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "From India to Bharat", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97566/from-india-to-bharat", "date_published": "Wed, 06 Apr 22 10:18:47 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIf centuries of plunder in the subcontinent, communal rifts and destructive power struggles were someone’s fault, whose were they? Were they ours? Was it theirs? I’m still searching for the answers but what I do know is that our past divided us then and it continues to divide us now. The fact that Narendra Modi’s India is a polarised state practicing blatant discrimination of minority communal groups and economic classes isn’t news. Modi’s rise to power isn’t an anomaly; it isn’t just a chapter in India’s history – it's a carefully crafted manifestation of an ideology. \n\nHave you ever wondered how and why Jawaharlal Nehru’s “azaad” India has embarked on such a journey? How and why is the very nature of the world’s largest democracy being rebuilt? Is it really that bad?\n\nHindutva: who is a Hindu?\n\nWith the arrival of European missionaries in India, the practice of proselytism not only threatened the socio-religious structure of society, it also brought changes in its demography. To resist the new faith, Hindu reformers endowed their religion with egalitarian values through a reinterpretation of the – highly abstract in nature – Vedas. This led to the creation of a golden age of Hinduism which was then supported by movements such as the Arya Samaj. The 1919 mobilisation of Indian Muslims in support of the Caliphate of Constantinople – the Khilafat movement – solidified the “majoritarian inferiority complex” of the Hindus due to its Pan-Islamic nature.\n\nIt was in this context that VD Savarkar codified the Hindu nationalist ideology, citing four factors in determining the eligibility of a “Hindu” – race (Aryan decent and Vedic fathers), territory (Vedic land where the holy rivers flow), language (Sanskrit) and culture. Savarkar also pointed out the similarities between his definition of “who is a Hindu” and the Zionists. MS Golwalkar’s views on the topic went one step ahead. He believed that Muslims of India did not deserve “even citizen rights” in the Hindu state. Their only option was to either submit or leave. These were the narratives which led to the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1925.\n\nTowards BJP\n\nThe organisation which started off by combating communists grew into a tentacular Sangh Parivar over the years with numerous sector-based organisations that gradually saturated the social space. The aim of the Sangh Parivar is state formation, not mere state-building. RSS entered the political arena in the 1950s after Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination by an alleged member of the movement and a close aid of Savarkar. Undoubtedly a dark time in the RSS’s history, the national outrage led to the arrests of 20,000 Swayamsevaks and the outlawing of the organisation which Nehru saw as an “Indian embodiment of fascism”. The Bharatiya Janata Sangh (BJS) was created by Golwalkar in 1951 in response to these developments.\n\nIn the time leading up to Modi’s rule in Gujrat, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, formerly BJS) had garnered considerable support in India, capitalising on its role in the Ayodhya Movement which resulted in violent clashes between the Hindu and Muslim communities during the “Ram Yatra”. Since then, the BJP has emerged as a populist party in India’s ethnic democracy which is against any and all things it deems a threat to the RSS ideology. The BJP’s primary targets are Muslims and Indian secularism. Its more concealed motives include the continued socioeconomic repression of the other backward classes (OBCs) and the scheduled castes (SCs), together with a complete dismantling of the very ethos of India’s once renowned impartial institutions.\n\nA lesson in populism \n\nIf there was ever a book titled “populism for dummies”, an account of Modi’s rise to power is sure to make an appearance. A product of the RSS, Modi in a true populist fashion rose to power following the Gujrat riots. During this time, violence was promoted and validated against Muslims, the “other”, by Modi and RSS radicals in response to the Godhra tragedy. Communal differences were then exacerbated to a point of no return, and it is from here that Modi’s populism turned into national populism. His humble beginnings helped him connect with the masses on an unprecedented scale and his shrewdness coupled with charisma propelled him into the status of an “ideal”. He was at once borne out of a mythology yet remained rooted in reality.\n\nDistancing himself from the Muslims, Modi established himself as an “Emperor of The Hindu Hearts”. His economic policies accelerated the growth rate in Gujrat – albeit at the expense of the proletariat – which would later lead him to tout the “Gujrat Model” in his 2014 election campaign. Subsequently, in the 2000s, when Islamic terrorism was at its peak, Modi would find himself at the centre of assassination attempts supposedly sponsored by ‘jihadis’. It did not matter that there was a complete lack of evidence to support the claims that the Pakistani state was behind this supposed threat, or that the ‘jihadis’ arrested were later acquitted by the Indian courts. He had established his national populist repertoire – a feat which would get him elected as the prime minister for two consecutive terms.\n\nThe first term \n\nDuring his first term, Modi focused on raising the “self-esteem” and “dignity” of the Indian people by introducing programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jan-Dhan Yojana, and Ujjwala Yojana. While there were no concrete reforms to help raise the economic status of his newly created “neo-middle class” or the poor, he also scaled back on the previously launched pro-poor programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Modi’s urban consumer bias was apparent in the economic policies put forth which facilitated crony capitalism. He diverted the people’s attention by focusing on social justice and keeping communal violence brewing to appease his “angry young men” who had taken the law into their own hands primarily through vigilantism (The Bajrang Dal).\n\nThis constant cycle of fear of the “Other” converting into anger was apparent in the activities of the Gau Rakshak Dal. Moreover, campaigns against ‘love jihad’ and ‘land jihad’ further unveiled the anti-Muslim sentiments of not only the state but Indian society as well. In the larger scheme of things, Modi’s politics led to the banalisation of Hindutva, reformation of the education system in line with the RSS ideology, crackdown on secularists and free press, ‘reconversion’ campaigns, opening up the state apparatus to the RSS, and deterioration of India’s once revered institutions including the police, Supreme Court, media, and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\n\nModi 2.0\n\nBy the 2019 elections, India had already converted into a “De-Facto Hindu Rashtra”. Staying true to his saintly politics, Modi centered his campaign on an “external enemy” – Pakistan. The Balakot strikes following the Pulwama attack, together with Pakistan’s goodwill gesture of Wing Commander Abhinandan’s release were hailed as ‘victories’ in India. Interestingly, Bharat, by then, had embarked on a path towards electoral authoritarianism, thus the main opposition parties barely stood a chance.\n\nCapitalising off caste politics and plebian support for the “strong man”, the BJP, with the conquest of the Rajya Sabha, was now in a position to fulfill its primary objectives – the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the abrogation of Article 370. The Ayodhya verdict was the final nail in India’s secular identity. Christophe Jaffrelot thereby concludes that India is now an ethnic democracy wherein the Hindus are bound by racial, linguistic, religious or other such cultural characteristics. Their strong sense of identity is pivotal for the rejection of the “other” which isn’t protected by the government nor the international community.\n\nThe greatest divide \n\nIn a democratic structure, regardless of the adjectives, claiming to be ‘apolitical’ is perhaps the highest tier of ignorance. If democracy is a government by the people, for the people, and from the people, how can the two ever be separated? Of course, outliers do exist, but when a feat is present in majority, it becomes the norm. BJP’s anti-Muslim bias, RSS’s Hindutva ideology, and Modi’s populist politics exist and thrive in India, for the Indian people, by the Indian citizens, from the Indian society. India’s polarisation was triggered by deep-seated insecurities, and with multiple fears and numerous threats – real or fake – assimilation becomes the best course of action. While there is beauty in diversity, there is security in homogenisation. It looks like the people of India have chosen their rulers. Where this majoritarian rule leads Bharat will unravel a new chapter in the history of war itself – the Greatest Divide is yet to come.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1649243028-0/Cover1649243028-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "What should be on the OIC’s agenda?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97560/what-should-be-on-the-oics-agenda", "date_published": "Tue, 22 Mar 22 11:13:05 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) signed a charter in 1969 aiming for peace, solidarity and mutual economic development. One premium objective of the charter is the commitment of the states to following ‘International Law.’ The charter also profoundly adopts the fundamental freedoms, human rights and good governance for development as the core of the international policy system and organisational structure. Although criticised, another landmark development under the OIC system was the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, which complements the Declaration on Human Rights and other United Nations (UN) human rights instruments.\n\nFurthermore, the Astana Declaration as policy guidance for investment in science, technology, education and development is significant for the effective implementation of sustainable development goals or the development agenda of 2030. As the OIC is the second largest intergovernmental organisation after the UN, it was expected that it would be safeguarding Muslim rights and interests in the global policy system.\n\nHowever, the charter governing the 1.8 billion in the contemporary era of globalisation is still seeking an effective implementation plan because most of the developing and underdeveloped Muslim states are equipped with poor governance and mismanaged structures. The objectivity of the OIC in the developmental agenda counters the hegemony and individualistic approaches. As members of the OIC are currently meeting in Islamabad, it is worth considering what the OIC should aim to achieve over the coming years.\n\nThe member states of the OIC implemented non-interference in their internal matters and pursued secular interests over the developmental agenda. The war among a few Muslim States is one example. Foreign intervention is another. This simultaneously indicated in the past that Muslim states’ inter-relations in sub-systems cannot be translated into one big policy umbrella. The given issues also highlight the apparent reasons for not having any meaningful Muslim representation in the global policy system.\n\nThe pertinent question now is how the OIC, as the key representing the authority of Muslim states, can be effective in the global policy system. OIC theoretically attempted to portray itself as an organisation that upholds the ‘global Islamic agenda’, and that it is somehow similar to the UN instruments reflecting human rights, peace and sustainable development. To implement the human rights agenda effectively, the OIC must think about an organisational structure that may monitor and report to the authorities. There could be a multilateral court of justice following the regional judicial systems of Europe, Africa and South America.\n\nMore legitimisation of the OIC through establishing a meaningful ‘executive’ under the sub-state system shall present a robust approach towards implementing the local agenda of 2030. The OIC may also think about more sub-committees or sub-groups on diverse but common development policy programmes.\n\nAlthough it seems that the OIC has a limited role in the effective implementation of the agenda of Muslim states, the OIC may rethink how the local implementation of global agendas can help its voice in the global policy system. The OIC can bring together the states and people for common issues such as climate change, poverty eradication, human development and environmentalism.\n\nWhat is more prominent is that the initial establishment of the OIC emphasised the ‘Ummah,’ which may encompass the Muslim representation worldwide and welcome integration of other states with the Muslim population. More importantly, the affiliation in the OIC system as a non-observer state can be closely linked to present challenges of corruption, poor governance, unsustainable development, climate change and environmental crises.\n\nIt is undeniable that financial assistance is the only way forward for such agendas, and for such purposes, more extensive integration in the OIC of developed states cannot be avoided. So far, the challenges of inequitable growth and development are not addressed by the international policy systems and are unlikely to be resolved. The UN 2030 agenda has already suggested regional and sub-regional integration for common goals towards more considerable cooperation.\n\nIf the OIC is seeking an influential role in the sustainable development agenda of 2030, it should reframe its existing governance mechanism. The recognition of the future development agenda as suggested by the UN shall be recognised by the OIC and shall address the 17 primary goals for human development in the Muslim states. In doing so, the OIC must reconsider the assistance of policy experts, academia, social scientists, stakeholders and specific-area experts. Such initiatives will provide the OIC with valuable global representation.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1647948826-0/Cover1647948826-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "India’s institutionalised prejudice against Islamophobia", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97557/indias-institutionalised-prejudice-against-islamophobia", "date_published": "Fri, 18 Mar 22 10:35:30 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIndia recently called out the United Nations (UN) resolution which declares May 15th as the International Day to combat Islamophobia. TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, expressed concern that an emphasis on one religion takes away attention from the phobias against Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism. He states that India had offered sanctuary to Zoroastrians, Jews and others in the spirit of pluralism and expressed concern regarding the attack on gurudwaras (Sikh temples), the destruction of Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, and the glorification of the breaking of idols. Tirumurti further said he instead preferred the generic term religion-phobia to combat hatred against all religions.\n\nSuch a position was to be expected from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) India, which is bent on ‘decolonising’ the influence of past Muslim invaders by furthering the dharmic faiths (Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism) at the expense of demonising present-day Muslims and Islam. The fact that the ruling party remains strategically quiet when calls for genocide of Muslims are made is a testament to this observation. Scores of Hindutva trolls are usually out and about on Pakistani and other social media sites where they demonise Muslims and perpetuate their victimhood despite being an overwhelming majority in India. It is against this backdrop that the Indian representative brazenly projected his country’s institutionalised prejudice.\n\nHowever, Tirumurti conveniently failed to recognise and mention the systemic genocide of the Rohingya Muslims by Buddhists in Myanmar, the concentration camps of Uighurs in China, the mass destruction of Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq in a post 9/11 world that has led to the universal singling out of Muslims and Islam. He ignored the fact that two billion Muslims are often generalised and stereotyped as terrorists and that many Sikhs in the West are targeted not because of their Sikhism but because they are perceived as Muslims. In other words, the targeting of people of colour and Sikhs in the West is also because of Islamophobia.\n\nIt is true that Hindu girls face forced conversion in the Sindh province of Pakistan, but this oppression is unique to that province (based on feudalism) and is not found in Arab countries. Similarly, the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was perpetrated by the rogue Taliban and not other Afghans who have enjoyed good relations with India. In fact, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has recently facilitated the construction of a large Hindu temple as well. The same goes for Pakistan that unilaterally took steps to facilitate Sikh pilgrims to their holy sites in Pakistan. If anything, it was the Indian government that took draconian steps against Sikhs and the Golden Temple in the mid-80s.\n\nThe Indian representative mentioned the glorification of the breaking of idols, which is reminiscent of the past Muslim invaders from central Asia in the age of empires. However, those Muslim invaders from Persia, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and other central Asian places are long dead. It was a different time where human rights violations were perpetrated by anyone and everyone. The sacking of Baghdad by the Mongols is one such example. However, the BJP and its leader Narendra Modi seem fixated on the past and not on the present where their government has singled out and marginalised Muslims through the Citizenship Act.\n\nThe whatbaoutism of the Indian state in an attempt to deflect attention away from Islamophobia towards “religion-phobia” is clear for everyone to see. The words of Tirumurti remind us of those white supremacists who argue against “Black Lives Matter” by responding with “All Lives Matter”, or of those homophobes who argue against the Pride Parade by resorting to the inanities of “what about Straight Parade”.\n\nIt is time India stops comparing itself to Pakistan, which itself has huge issues of intolerance, and starts addressing its internal issues of the systemic discrimination and Hindutva calls for genocide of their own Muslim minorities.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1647603749-0/Cover1647603749-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistani migrants bounce back", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2370889/pakistani-migrants-bounce-back", "date_published": "Fri, 12 Aug 22 20:47:25 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe number of Pakistani nationals migrating for work mostly to the Gulf countries has bounced back to the pre-Covid-19 level to around 65,000 per month in January 2022 in the wake of rising income of oil exporting Arab countries and advanced economies around the world.\n\n“The monthly flow of Pakistani workers (abroad) has reverted to pre-Covid levels,” the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in its half-yearly report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for July-December of fiscal year 2021-22 released on Friday.\n\nOver 70% of Pakistani workers go to GCC countries mostly to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nThe number of migrating Pakistani workers plunged to zero during the initial five months of the pandemic – April-August 2020, according to the central bank’s report.\n\nThe normalisation of the flow of workers to foreign countries along with a surge in the income of oil exporting GCC countries indicates the inflow of workers’ remittances to Pakistan will remain steady at around “$32 billion in the current fiscal year 2023 compared to $31 billion in FY22”, Topline Research projected last week.\n\nAs many as 458,257 Pakistanis proceeded abroad for employment in the first seven months (January-July) of 2022.

It was January 2020 when around 65,000 Pakistani went abroad for job purposes last time before the outbreak of the virus in Pakistan in February 2020.\n\nThe central bank’s report said no word on the economic outlook for the current fiscal year 2023, as it usually does in its quarterly, half-yearly and annual reports. Instead, it gave an outdated outlook for the second half (January-June) of FY22.\n\nTo recall, the country achieved economic growth of 6% for the second consecutive fiscal year in 2021-22.\n\nThe central bank said in its latest State of Pakistan’s Economy report that the collection of revenue in taxes to the government increased notably, but mostly due to increased imports during the first half of the previous fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. \n\nFederal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) collection of revenue in taxes increased by 32% in the first half of FY22, notwithstanding somewhat slower growth in the second quarter (Oct-Dec FY22), as economic activities improved and general price levels rose as compared to last year.\n\n“However, most of this increase stemmed from import-related taxes, on account of the broad-based increase in import volumes, international commodity prices, and PKR (Pakistani rupee) depreciation,” SBP said in the report.\n\nThe government, however, sharply cut imports in the first month (July) of the current fiscal year 2022 to $4.9 billion to avert the risk of default on international payments ahead of the resumption of IMF’s extended $7 billion loan programme in last week of the current month of August 2022.\n\nThe imports had hit a five-month high at $2.3 billion in June.\n\nFinance Minister Miftah Ismail said the other day the curb on imports would remain in place over the next three to four-month to improve the country’s capacity to make import payments and foreign debt 946,571 repayments.\n\nThe import curtailment may compromise FBR collection of revenue in taxes in the three to fourth-month of low imports in FY23.\n\nFrom the perspective of the first half of FY22, the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) exhibited broad-based expansion, exports grew buoyant alongside growth in FBR taxes and Kharif crops recorded higher production, the central bank said.\n\nHowever, amid multi-year high global commodity prices, rising inflation and current account deficit posed a challenge as the year progressed, it said.\n\n“These pressures necessitated monetary tightening amidst other regulatory measures to moderate demand.”­­\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 13th, 2022.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/41660337318-0/41660337318-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Senate panel seeks details of PIA pilots", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2310861/senate-panel-seeks-details-of-pia-pilots", "date_published": "Fri, 16 Jul 21 06:16:48 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Senate Standing Committee on Aviation on Thursday sought details of the pilots working with the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and was briefed on the functions of the Aviation Division and its attached departments.\n\nThe committee meeting, chaired by Hidayatullah, reviewed working procedures, budget, number of employees, challenges faced by the Aviation Division and its subsidiaries and the performance of the institutions.\n\nAmong others, the meeting was attended by senators Syed Muhammad Sabir Shah, Faisal Saleem Rehman, Mian Raza Rabbani, Aun Abbas, Faisal Javed, Saleem Mandviwalla, Afnanullah Khan, Dilawar Khan and Sherry Rehman, besides Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Aviation Secretary Ali, Adviser to CEO PIA Amir Hayat, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Director General Flight Lieutenant (retd) Khaqan Murtaza, Airport Security Force chief security officer, Pakistan Meteorological Department director general and other senior officials.\n\nIt also looked into the measures taken by the Aviation Division to improve performance of the attached departments and its future plans to tackle challenges confronted on the professional front.\n\nIt was the committee's first meeting after its reconstitution followed by the Senate elections.\nHidayatullah said the committee proceedings would be made more effective with mutual consultation of the members so that the confronted issues could be removed in an efficient manner.

Kamran Ghulam\n\nKamran Ghulam may not be a household name yet since he hasn’t represented Pakistan national team till now, but people who follow domestic cricket closely know him as the next big thing.\n\nThe right-handed batsman, in the recently concluded Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, bettered the record for most runs in a single QeA Trophy season. The record, earlier held by Saadat Ali with 1217 runs, was broken by Ghulam in the final of the tournament where he was representing Khyber-Pakhtukhwa.\n\nHowever, this is not the only thing that pushed Wasim to include the 25-year-old in the squad.\n\nGhulam boasts a first-class average of over 53 with 31 matches to his name. He has scored nine 100s and 11 fifties to amass 2,413 runs, with a highest score of 166.\n\nIf he can build on his current domestic form when playing against South Africa, the visitors will find it hard to beat Pakistan in the two-Test series.\n\n2. Tabish Khan\n\nIf you’re a pacer outside Pakistan, you’ll probably start your career in mid or late-twenties and end it after your mid-thirties. However, right-arm medium pacer Tabish Khan will start his international career at 36.\n\nSome may say he was not international material, but with 598 wickets in 137 first-class matches, there is and there never was a valid reason to keep him out of the national fray. Well, he’s not the only one who had to wait a long time to get his chance, Fawad Alam is another case study in this regard too.\n\nThere is light at the end of every tunnel and Tabish had to travel miles to find his light and he would love to grab the chance with both hands when he bowls to the South Africans in Karachi and Rawalpindi in the two Tests.\n\nJury is out on whether he will be able to live up to the hype after spending his heydays in the domestic wilderness, but if Tabish wants to question a system which gives multiple chances to a few and nearly zero to some, he will have to utilise all the experience he has gained and get his first and maybe final hurrah on the international level.\n\n3. Saud Shakeel\n\nAnother youngster, with heaps of runs behind him and a first-class average of nearly 49, Saud Shakeel will don the greens of Pakistan during the two Tests against South Africa.\n\nAt the age 25, Shakeel has 3220 runs in his books in 46 first-class outings. He also has 10 tons and 17 fifties to boast about and if this is not enough, he can bowl left-arm slow.\n\nShakeel has come to the fore through the Pakistan cricket ranks and has played for the U19 team, which may prove to be a point in his favour as he had the grooming of a cricketer from an early age.\n\nAll in all, Pakistan have played a big gamble by benching their usual suspects and giving the domestic performers a chance to shine. This move may turn new chief selector Wasim into a hero that many were waiting for, however it can backfire too.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Kamran-Ghulam-PCB1611139704-0/Kamran-Ghulam-PCB1611139704-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "4 players who can help Pakistan beat New Zealand in third T20I", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2276840/4-players-who-can-help-pakistan-beat-new-zealand-in-third-t20i", "date_published": "Mon, 21 Dec 20 09:53:42 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan are against the ropes in the three-match T20I series against New Zealand as they’ve lost the opening two games and only a win in third shortest-format game can help them gain much-needed confidence when going into the Tests.\n\nPakistan stayed rigid in their approach and played the same elevens in the first two T20Is, but with the series already lost, it is high time Pakistan try something new on the field against New Zealand.\n\nWhile the option of chasing may present itself if Pakistan win the toss third time on the trot, a few changes in the eleven can also be beneficial for the stand-in captain Shadab Khan.\n\nHere are the three players who can walk in and help Pakistan win the third T20I against New Zealand.\n\n1. Sarfaraz Ahmed\n\nIf you ask a Pakistani cricket fan why Sarfaraz Ahmed was sent into the wilderness, even after taking Pakistan to the summit of the T20I rankings, they would not mention his batting, his wicketkeeping or his captaincy, but they’d rather blame it on him being a Karachi player.\n\nWhether this theory of the Pakistan Cricket Board being biased against Karachi players is true or not, one thing everyone can agree on is that Sarfaraz brings something to the field which many other players can’t – the much-needed energy.\n\nSarfaraz was famous for his animated and chatty wicketkeeping when he was captaining Pakistan in all formats and even though some may disagree, the energy he brought with his shenanigans was contagious.\n\nHim walking to the bowler before and after every delivery, his comments when someone dropped a catch or did a great job in the fielding, all of that is missed with Muhammad Rizwan behind the stumps.\n\nWith Shadab at the helm against a New Zealand side which he is finding very difficult to outwit, an experienced former captain behind the stumps can go a long way in helping Pakistan enforce a win when everything has failed to work.\n\n2 and 3. Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa\n\nWahab Riaz is not doing what he is supposed to do in New Zealand – be the experienced leader of the young bowling pack, and this gives way to Pakistan go for the young but express pace duo of Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa.\n\nInclusion of Musa can also help Shaheen Afridi take a much-needed rest before he is asked to run in and fire on all cylinders during the upcoming Tests.\n\nAlso, if Pakistan really want to make things interesting, they can always replace Haris Rauf with Iftikhar Ahmed. Iftikhar is considered to be a big-hitter, and also can bowl four overs of off-spin. Since New Zealand are perfectly fine when dealing with pacers, a spin of strategy may work in Pakistan’s favour.\n\n4. Usman Qadir\n\nWe all saw what the legendary spinner Abdul Qadir’s son Usman Qadir got from his father – a spin bowling masterclass.\n\nShadab has been off colour in the bowling department in the first two matches, maybe because of his increased focus on batting and recently captaincy and Usman can help fill the shoes of team’s first-choice leggie.\n\nIf there’s a question of who he should replace in the side, anyone between Khushdil Shah and Abdullah Shafique can give way to Usman, as many may still now know that he has the ability to bat quite nicely in the lower order.\n\nPakistan will be concluding their shortest-format series in the third T20I against New Zealand on Tuesday and they will need something new to surprise the hosts and make them submit. However, if they play safe and don’t make any changes, they will surely lose again, with dignity yes, but they will lose.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/comment1608542933-0/comment1608542933-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "3 reasons Pakistan lost first T20I against New Zealand", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2276467/3-reasons-pakistan-lost-first-t20i-against-new-zealand", "date_published": "Fri, 18 Dec 20 12:36:48 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThere was never a doubt that Pakistan would find it difficult to beat New Zealand at the latter’s home and the theory was proven true when the Kiwis beat Men in Green by five wickets in the first T20I of the three-match series on Friday.\n\nWith the defeat, Pakistan will have to pull up their socks for the next two T20Is if they want to salvage the series and win it.\n\nIt was also a sad day for Pakistan stand-in captain Shadab Khan who lost the very first T20I, where he stood as captain.\n\nA closer look of the first T20I shows there were a few things Pakistan could have changed or could have done to prevent the loss in the tour opener.\n\n1. No specialist openers\n\nPakistan won the toss and chose to bat first, but they missed the trick when they asked wicketkeeper-batsman Muhammad Rizwan and newcomer Abdullah Shafique to open the innings against New Zealand.\n\nUnfamiliar with the opening role, Rizwan lost his wicket due to a callous drive and a smart delivery by Jacob Duffy, while Shafique was found out in the second delivery he faced against the Kiwis. Shafique couldn’t fathom the bounce on the pitch and flighted one into the hands of mid-on fielder for an easy catch.\n\nWith the openers gone quickly, as has been the case for Pakistan since eternity, the middle-order, lacking the services of the great Babar Azam, fell like a deck of cards, thus the question of why did Pakistan go with two batsmen upfront who don’t understand the demands of the opener’s role.\n\n2. Batting failure (again)\n\nWith the openers gone, the onus fell on the middle-order to stabilise the innings, but a young Haider Ali was not up to the task. Here, once again, Pakistan did not think twice before sending him at the one-down position, where teams tend to send their best and most in-form batsman.\n\nHaider is all that and a little more, but he lacks the experience of playing at the third spot. However, the next best option to bat at number three, veteran Muhammad Hafeez, did equally bad in batting after being dismissed on the very first ball he faced.\n\nAll thanks to Shadab’s 42 off 32 and a late flurry by Faheem Ashraf, who scored 31 off 18, Pakistan were able to put up a fighting total, but if the top and upper middle-order would have added an extra 20 or 30, the match could’ve shifted in the visitors’ favour.\n\n3. The Wahab dilemma\n\nTo play him or not to play him has become one of the major questions Pakistan faces whenever they go out in the field. If Afridi’s is the pinnacle of mercurial batting, Wahab is all that in the bowling department.\n\nOne day, he would pluck the moon out of the sky for Pakistan and the next day he would turn a certain victory into a miraculous defeat. Is it just bad luck, or is it just his bad bowling at some points, no one can truly answer.\n\nThe latter happened on Friday, when Wahab gave away 45 runs in just 3.5 overs after being hit for two sixes and five fours. New Zealand batsmen were bamboozled in the middle of the innings by some top-notch bowling by Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Faheem Ashraf, but Wahab leaking away runs gave New Zealand the much-needed confidence.\n\nAnd if all that was not enough, Faheem dropped a catch off Wahab at fine leg and to add insult to injury, let the ball crawl away for a four.\n\nIt is quite evident now that people are prone to dropping catches off Wahab’s bowling at fine leg and square leg region. Everyone would remember the disastrous drop in the 2015 World Cup by Rahat Ali where Wahab had setup Shane Watson perfectly with world class short-pitched bowling.\n\nSo, do we curse the man or do we curse his luck, at least I can’t answer this dilemma.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/comment1608294842-0/comment1608294842-0-68779.jpg"}, {"headline": "3 reasons Pakistan will find it difficult to beat New Zealand", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2274087/3-reasons-pakistan-will-find-it-difficult-to-beat-new-zealand", "date_published": "Mon, 30 Nov 20 07:44:32 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan contingent is currently in quarantine in New Zealand as they prepare for face the hosts in three T20Is and two Tests, and there is only one thing that is certain in the current uncertain Covid-19 time – it won’t be easy to beat the Kiwis.\n\nHere are the three main reasons why Babar Azam can return winless, in the series and in all the T20Is and Tests, from New Zealand.\n\n1. Bad morale\n\nAfter news of Pakistani players testing positive surfaced, the team must have seen a fall in their morale as, according to reports, many first team players were affected with the virus.\n\nThis could have led to drop in motivation, while a warning to send the whole squad home after some players breached the Covid-19 protocol was also not inspiring.\n\nPakistan players may be pumped up to beat New Zealand in the latter’s own yard after such humiliation, but with players in gloomy isolation, losing hope and feeling down may be the most probable outcome of the saga.\n\n2. Lack of fitness and practice\n\nEveryone knows about Pakistani’s love for food and our cricketers are just humans. With nothing much to do in hotel rooms, food might be the only entertainment they’ve had through the first half of their quarantine. Hence, a lack of practice may cause lethargy when they hit the ground.\n\nAll this may result in lack of efforts in the field and as the adage of catches win matches goes, a few slipups are a possibility too.\n\nPakistani players will have to put some extra yards in before the matches, otherwise, if they do just enough, the performances will also be just enough and New Zealand will roll over the Men in Green with ease.\n\n3. New Zealand’s form\n\nNew Zealand may not have won many global cricketing tournaments, but they are not known for their big trophy cabinet, they are known for their consistency.\n\nIf they are not the best on a given day, you can surely expect them to be at their minimum best at least. Meanwhile, their opponents Pakistan are known to be the most mercurial cricketing side in the world – “one minute down, next minute up”.\n\nIt is this consistency in New Zealand’s performance that makes them a difficult side to beat and add home advantage to that and it becomes a perfect recipe for Pakistan’s destruction in the series.\n\nAlso, they are unbeaten in the T20Is in the series against West Indies. Their form can be seen in the fact that they have scored quickly in the first two matches, setting a 239-run target in first and chasing a 180-run target in just 16 overs in the second.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistani players last played cricket during the remaining matches of the PSL5.\n\nMomentum will be on New Zealand’s side when they host Pakistan, first for T20Is and then for Tests. Babar will have to come up with a magical formula to lift the spirit of the players who will be feeling under the weather, homesick, and also out of form and practice. If the skipper can do that then he may not only go on to become a batting legend, but also a captain whose name would be written in golden words.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Comment1606722149-0/Comment1606722149-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Is Trump right in saying ‘India is filthy’?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2270253/is-trump-right-in-saying-india-is-filthy", "date_published": "Wed, 28 Oct 20 13:11:05 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhile the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden produced fireworks, Trump’s remarks in the environmental context that “India is filthy”, became a matter of heated debate within Indian media. Indian social media went berserk and its reaction also became prominent on mainstream media. Some went on to ask Trump for an apology on these remarks, which most of Sanghi trolls thought had hurt millions of common Indians.\n\nWhile any nation would react to such remarks from any leader of global stature, Trump’s remarks had a profound effect as Mr Modi has done a lot of work to develop a personal relationship with Trump through the “Howdy,Modi!” rally in the United States and “Namaste Trump” programme duringTrump’s visit to India this year.\n\nWhile we respect Indian sentiments, it may be interesting to conduct an analysis of where does India stand in terms of cleanliness and environment.\n\nAccording to IndiaSpend’sState of Global Air 2020 report,116,000 infants died in India due to air pollution in 2019 — meaning one infant died every five minutes due to air pollution. The data further reveals that 1.67 million Indians died in 2019 due to air pollution causes.\n\nAs per a World Health Organisation report, approximately 120,000 children under the age of five years die due to diarrhoea every year. This indicates that waterborne diseases are rampant in India due to contaminated water and poor sanitation.Hookworms, which can spread through open defecation, cause diarrhoea, anaemia and weight loss in women, according to the report. These problems are linked to low birth weight and slow child growth — 38% of children in India under five are stunted, according to the National Family Health Survey data.\n\nThe Indian magazine, The Wire, reported in 2017, that India, the world’s second-largest country by population, had the highest number of people (732 million) without access to toilets. The report by WaterAid, titled “Out Of Order: The State of the World’s Toilets 2017”, further stated that 355 million women and girls lacked access to a toilet. If they were to stand in a line, the queue could circle the Earth more than four times.\n\nThe problem is that Modi’sSwachh Bharat or Clean India programme built millions of toilets at avery fast pace across Indian landscape; however, these have become dilapidated and unusable,adding to the problem. Adding to that is the factor of demographics: Indian population has grown from 1,330 million in 2017 to 1,380 million in 2019, that’s an additional load of 50 million. So even if India builds one million new toilets every year it cannot match the pace of population growth.\n\nA CNet report published on September 11, 2020, states that India spent $30 billion to fix its broken sanitation. It ended up with more problems. The Swachh Bharat mission, launched in 2014, was an ambitious effort to stop open defecation. It's far from reaching that goal.Lack of enough water to use in Swachh Bharat was bound to make it a failure. Imagine a community toilet built for 500 people in a cramped city with irregular or no supply of water. Within a week, it will not only become unusable but also become a source of disease spread. A survey of open source pictures and videos of Swachh Bharat toilets in overpopulated cities indicates that this grand programme has become a virtual dustbin.\n\nIn 2019, India was also home to 21 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities, studies say, based on air-quality data. Coal usage in power generation stands at a whopping 75% and coal is notoriously bad for environment. No wonder New Delhi maintains the record of being the most polluted capital of the world for the second consecutive year. Even drinking water of the Indian capital is contaminated, The Hindu, in 2019,sarcastically remarked, “If it wasn’t enough that Delhi air is among the world’s most polluted, a new study has now shown that the city’s tap water is the most unsafe among 21 states within India.”\n\nIndian rivers have become almost toxic due to overpopulation and flow of sewage and industrial waste into rivers which hug large cities.Oceanplasticcleanup.com conducted a study of the most filthy, polluted and toxic rivers in the world called the “Dirty Dozen”, and lo and behold, India gets another honour with the Ganges as the second most polluted river in the world and Yamuna as the fifth filthiest.\n\nThe Ganges has a perennial problem of religious rituals.Gangapollution.com keeps a watch on issues related to it. One of its report highlighted the pollution in Indian rivers: many parts of the Hindu faith revolve around the Ganges River, who they believe is the form of the goddess Mother Ganga on Earth. Because of this, many people’s bodies and ashes are placed in the river. Large amounts of ashes from crematoriums along the Ganges River in Varanasi are dumped in each year. Majority of Hindus are cremated and placed in the river after being burned by Dalits along the ghats leading into their goddess’ body. These ashes are keeping the river from being clean.\n\nDead bodies are also a huge pollutant to the already dirty water, with 35,000 bodies estimated to be discarded into the river,yearly. This is huge amount of dead people to be floating in an important source of water for millions of people. Many times, international observers have pointed out to the Indian government to take effective measures for respect of human remains as pictures of human bodies floating in the Ganges River surface almost every month.\n\nOther than air pollution, poor sanitation, filthy rivers and water contamination, India stands tall in noise population as well.A LiveMintreport on noise pollution in India describes an alarming picture.\n\nThe red light at a traffic junction is the universal sign for vehicles to stop — but in India, it is also a signal to start something else: relentless honking. When noise from constant honking is added to the general cacophony in cities, it becomes noise pollution — and this pollution can be costly and dangerous too.\n\nKnops.co conducts regular surveys of noise pollution across the globe. Its 2018 report puts India in the top noise polluted countries in the world. The Worldwide Hearing Index was created some time ago by digital hearing app founders, Mimi Hearing Technologies GmbH. They analysed the hearing test results of 200,000 of their users. They combined their results with data on noise pollution from WHO and SINTEF, a Norwegian-based research organisation, and used it to plot noise pollution in 50 different cities. The top five cities with the worst noise pollution include Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nTo conclude, President Trump may have casually mentioned ‘filthy India’, referring to environmental issues without much attention to research and scientific evidence, but he has been proven right. India tops the list of the most polluted countries in the world in sanitation, water, air, hygiene and even noise.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2182545-adeelanaureennew-1584984008.jpg"}, {"headline": "Why we need fear for effective disaster risk reduction", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2268212/why-we-need-fear-for-effective-disaster-risk-reduction", "date_published": "Tue, 13 Oct 20 13:18:35 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tToday is the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and living in a time of a global pandemic, the need to prioritise disaster risk reduction has become resounding and all too very real as almost every person and community is suffering from institutional and socio-economic lack of preparedness. \n\nPandemics are not new. Scientists and historians have been warning against a global novel virus for the past few decades. Beating their beakers and drums, trying to raise awareness among governments and businesses that this is not of a matter of if, but when. When the Ebola outbreak wreaked havoc in West Africa, the US State Department, under then president Barack Obama’s administration developed a comprehensive guide in dealing with and mitigating infectious diseases. This was of course completely thrown out by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nOn October 8, just a few days ago, Pakistan saw the clock tick to 15 years since the devastating earthquake of 2005. Pakistan bore colossal losses then. Nearly 20,000 children died while they were attending classes. In total, about 85,000 people died, another 140,000 injured and 3.5 million became homeless as 0.6 million houses were severely damaged.\n\nPakistan’s north was particularly devastated and Balakot, the epicentre, was destroyed in a matter of seconds and 15 years on is still struggling to re-build infrastructure and lives. There is hardly any significant rehabilitation or reconstruction. Rather, the funds that were allotted for Balakot’s rehabilitation have been redistributed to the Benazir Income Support Programme(BISP) and Covid-19 Emergency Fund. This speaks to how ill-prepared our DRR is, that funds for one disaster are siphoned for others.\n\nDRR is an incredibly lofty goal for a country that cannot rehabilitate its citizens from disasters that took place almost two decades ago. Pakistan is not the only country unable to learn from past mistakes and lack of preparedness. As stated above, the US, and rather most countries during the Covid-19 pandemic have proven the amnesia that collectively surrounds us when it comes to the destruction of disasters.\n\nDanish philosopherSørenKierkegaard makes a distinction between the concept of dread and fear calling attention to fear as having an object, a definable threat that we can identify. Whereas, dread is a response shrouded in unknowns, is speculative, not belonging to parameters or definitions. \n\nWe are unequivocally living in a global time of fear. We fear the coronavirus, we fear loss of jobs, lives, travel, routine, any semblance to the “old normal”. Our fear is driving conversations and changes around the “Great Reset”: how can this disaster be learned from in such a way that we build back the world, better?\n\nWhat can be changed about the status quo that protects citizens beyond economic and political interests? \n\nHow can this ‘new’normal truly be transformative and inclusive?\n\nFear’s object allows for these conversations to have actionable points and attainable goals. Fear makes having a game-plan easier. Fear divides people into groups of: ‘part of the solution’ or ‘part of the problem,’ as is evidenced by corona-shaming of non-mask wearers and political leaders who had to retract fake news and disinformation.\n\nDRR for objects of fear, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, is timely and due to its global nature, which unlike Ebola which was predominantly contained within the context of “poor” countries, Covid-19’s fear is ubiquitous and has spread to contexts that are not used to suffering —‘developing country’ailments. The politics of fear is also always at play. Who is fearful,who is bearing the brunt of the threat is always imperative. Thus, DRR for infectious diseases is at the forefront of the priority list and perhaps, rightly so.\n\nDread on the other hand, is objectless, casting anxiety far and wide without aim and thus, is much more insurmountable than fear. Many of us dread climate change in an abstract way. We hear the news of sea levels rising. We notice the irregularities of the seasons. We breathe in toxic air like it is a non-negotiable aspect of nature. We watch gut-wrenching clips of starving farmers and drowning residents. \n\nOften though these realities are not directly our own. The dread and threat of climate change is still far away, neatly tucked away somewhere in the future. This is why business-as-usual is the state of affairs when it comes to the economy, government, consumer behaviour and social order. \n\nDRR for dread does not have the same timely impact as DRR for fear.\n\nUnlike DRR for infectious diseases, DRR for climate change is failing to account for human, social and political disaster amnesia.\n\nWhen dread turns to fear, as one may have experienced during the recent floods that engulfed Karachi and other parts of the country, there is suddenly an actionable sensibility that grips citizens and governments alike. Especially when those citizens were elites and urbane. The problem solving caps come on as people are united against a common threat.\n\nHowever, as human populations have made unprecedented exponential advancements in the last three decades, the myriad of threats have also of course, multiplied. Existential threats such as Artificial Intelligence, climate change, cyber warfare, pandemics, to name a few, have caused mounting existential dread invariably leading to inertia of sorts.\n\nI guess the trillion dollar question is: how do we capture what we know about the difference between fearand dread to formulate and implement DRR that works with the psychology and sociology of communities and countries?\n\nThis year, the theme of the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction is governance which is defined as the measure by which“lives are saved, reduced numbers of disaster-affected people and reduced economic losses. Covid-19 and the climate emergency are telling us that we need a clear vision, plans and competent, empowered institutions acting on scientific evidence for the public good.”\n\nUnfortunately, we are all still enveloped in a fear-centric mode of thinking when it comes to DRR. For instance, Prime Minister Imran Khan has recently approved the construction of high-rise buildings in Islamabad. This is problematic for several reasons from a DRR and urban planning perspective.\n\nFirstly, contrary to popular opinion, high-rises are not green solutions. In fact, high-rises encourage vehicular clutter causing serious damage to both environment and humans alike, by increasing air pollution. Vertical urban sprawl wreaks havoc on air quality. \n\nSecondly, high-rise buildings are energy-intensive as glass is simply not very good at keeping excessive heat out, or desirable heat in. Even with technological advancement, the amount of power it takes to keep high-rises going poses a huge opportunity cost to greener solutions. \n\nLastly, Pakistan has many seismic zones and as many high-rises are vulnerable to earthquakes and not always structurally sound, the proliferation of high-rises in the country can pose mammoth near-future risks. Furthermore, high-rises, pose evacuation concerns. If you live or work in a high-rise apartment, you'll face a harder challenge trying to evacuate due to emergencies, such as natural disasters or fire.\n\nIt is said, “earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings do,” which begs the question why is our government taking urban planning measures that are increasing disaster risks rather than reducing them?\n\nOur Prime Minister has repeatedly said, “ghabrana nahi hai (don’t get scared)”; but, when it comes to disaster risk reduction, it would be very wise to be fearful.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Mavra-Bari1602595736-0/Mavra-Bari1602595736-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Public complaints", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2265484/public-complaints", "date_published": "Thu, 24 Sep 20 19:06:54 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn order to further facilitate the public and speed up redressal of their grievances, the government plans to link up all complaint management systems of federal ministries with the Pakistan Citizen Portal. Prime Minister Imran Khan recently issued instructions in this regard. All existing 33 complaint cells of federal ministries will be connected with the centralised complaint system. The PM’s Performance Delivery Unit (PMDU) will decide the modalities in consultation with relevant institutions and devise integration plans. The PMDU has been asked to complete the process within 60 days. The idea is to avoid delays resulting from a multiplicity of complaint cells and duplication of efforts thereby undertaking the process of complaint rectification on a fast track basis. This will also save time and resources. The purpose is to put in place a universal system with many-faceted connectivity features for a comprehensive global grievance redressal mechanism.\n\nThe centralised system will help citizens avoid confusion as now a number of complaint cells are functioning causing problems to both the people and government functionaries working for redressal of public grievances. The integrated system will help eliminate the delays involved in manual processing of complaints. It will bring the whole process of receipt, processing, and removal of complaints under one window, and help citizens get information about the status of their complaints and things related to them. The PCP started functioning as part of the PMDU from October 2018. During the past two years, as many as 28 million people have registered 115,000 complaints, on average, every month, with it. According to official figures, 2.2 million complaints have been resolved with 40% confirmed satisfaction. The rural population might not be getting the facility of the online PCP because of the unavailability of internet services in villages and small towns.

The false dreams that many of them have are regularly shattered by the harsh reality of India’s still-strong caste system, which rarely allows lower-caste Hindus to rise. Many of the Pakistani Hindu migrants are from those lower castes. For this, they often end up having to wait for decades to be allowed to become citizens of a country that claims to welcome all Hindus.\n\nPakistan Hindu Council Patron-In-Chief Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani made a much more explosive claim that Indian intelligence agencies have been forcing Pakistani Hindu migrants and tourists to speak against Pakistan and even killing people who refuse to do so. As evidence, Vankwani referred to the last month’s case of 11 members of a family who died under mysterious circumstances in the Indian city of Jodhpur in Rajasthan. The family had moved there years ago, motivated by those same false promises of a better life in India. Instead, they ended up being poisoned in their home.\n\nThe case itself is interesting for the secretive manner in which India has acted. The family of subsistence farmers was clearly not spies, yet India has refused to share any investigation details with Pakistan or allowed access to the survivors, even though they all were still Pakistani citizens at the time they died.\n\nVankwani implied that this was because a surviving family member had nominated the RSS and the ruling BJP in the police report. He also noted that no arrests had been made in the case which is extremely concerning.\n\nAfter decades of throwing accusations about the treatment of Hindus in neighbouring Muslim countries, India has shown that it is just as dangerous.

Unfortunately, failure to update election and political financing laws, or even enforce existing ones, is a collective failure of the political parties and the bureaucracy because it deprives citizens of their basic rights, while also ensuring that truly independent candidates from middle-class or poor backgrounds just can’t compete with the big guns. But maybe that is the point — securing the positions of the ruling elite while also ensuring that they stay in line. \n\nOver the weekend, open government and election transparency advocates at the Free and Fair Election Network , or Fafen, also brought up how political parties inside and outside the parliament need to strengthen regulations to limit the ability of big spenders to virtually buy elections, warning that free-spending without consequences deprives citizens of the right to contest elections and skews results towards big spenders, regardless of whether they are backed by billionaires or smaller, individual donors. \n\nThe weaknesses in the system begin with the current iteration of the law governing elections — the Elections Act of 2017. The act is astoundingly weak in its grants of regulatory power, and can be directly blamed — along with its authors — for allowing the 2018 general election to turn into the biggest spending polling cycles in the country’s history, even when inflation is taken into account. Bye-elections and local bodies polls conducted since then have also seen unprecedented spending, effectively consolidating power among the ultra-rich, whether directly as candidates or through the political parties they bankroll. Strongly enforced spending caps can be problematic in bigger constituencies and areas with higher advertising costs, but they are still probably the easiest place to start. \n\nDonor transparency is another area which needs to be investigated. This could be done through a public database which parties and candidates must regularly update with every political donation received and details of how funds are spent. The same would also apply to private groups and individuals financing political campaigns. Criminal penalties, as long as they are fairly applied, would be more than enough to change the face of Pakistani electioneering, certainly making it cleaner and, hopefully, a little more representative.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 11th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "PDM fiddles while the economy burns", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369873/pdm-fiddles-while-the-economy-burns", "date_published": "Sat, 06 Aug 22 18:44:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe only thing seesawing faster than the Pakistani rupee right now is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s political capital. So, here’s a contrarian take on what’s happening to the Pakistani economy. The real crisis is one of confidence, and not just economic fundamentals. Consider this: Pakistan faced a similar economic crisis at the beginning of PTI’s term and then again at the beginning of Covid-19. In both cases, stability and economic growth were restored. In fact, unlike most countries where public debt rose significantly during Covid-19, we were able to reduce our public debt-to-GDP ratio by about five percentage points through Covid-19. So, why does this economic crisis feel like the end of the world?\n\nThe underlying crisis of confidence this time is rooted in politics versus economics. Let’s unpack the previous economic crisis Pakistan overcame to contextualise this one better. To simplify, PTI’s core challenge in 2018 was inheriting an unsustainable current account deficit with the country standing on the brink of dollar default, while PML-N’s core challenge was to reverse fuel subsidies. The first two years of PTI’s government were hard for our economy because PML-N gave an ailing economy to Asad Umar. \n\nThe primary challenge was a current account deficit of $20 billion thanks to Dar’s fixation on keeping the rupee artificially overvalued versus the dollar. An artificially high rupee meant it was cheaper to import things than to produce them in Pakistan or export goods. Hence, our industry hollowed out, exports declined during PML-N’s tenure and imports we couldn’t afford thrived, bringing us to the verge of bankruptcy when PTI took over. \n\nPTI took politically unpopular but wise decisions to correct these sins, including the painful devaluation of the currency. The idea was they would rescue the economy first, then stabilise and then put it on the growth path. Halfway through stabilisation, Covid-19 hit. Despite Covid-19 though, Pakistan clocked in growth at over 5% over the last two years. This was so good that PML-N argued last year that the numbers had been fudged by the PTI government, only to validate growth numbers this year after over-throwing the PTI government. PML-N even used these healthy growth numbers to secure the latest IMF deal. \n\nHowever, when the PML-N was strategising to overthrow PTI through a vote of no confidence, their primary argument was that PTI was mismanaging the economy and a competent team was needed to restore order. Four months later, we are experiencing the fruits of labour from team competence, with the rupee nosediving and inflation skyrocketing. \n\nIn a provocative recent column, former State Bank Governor, Raza Baqir asks why this crisis feels more dramatic when the economic fundamentals are actually better than before: ‘Given that we successfully restored stability and growth in the recent two challenging crises, why is there not a shared sense of calm confidence that we should be able to do the same this time round? This question is particularly relevant because our reserves and public debt are better today than they were in the 2019 balance-of-payments crisis before the start of the IMF programme. At end-June 2019, our gross reserves had dipped to around $7bn; at end-June 2022 they were around $10bn.’\n\nHe goes on to argue about the central role politics is playing in this crisis. And the next logical question to ask is what is the core driver of the political instability in the country today? The answer to that question is simple, the vote of no confidence against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The irony is that while PDM brought a no-confidence motion against Imran Khan, it’s the Pakistani economy that’s expressing no confidence in the PDM government today. If there’s one lesson everyone can learn from this train wreck, it’s that civilian Prime Ministers should be allowed to complete their five-year terms for both political and economic stability.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 7th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131.JPG"}, {"headline": "Afghan humanitarian crisis", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369656/afghan-humanitarian-crisis", "date_published": "Fri, 05 Aug 22 18:34:35 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfghanistan has a long history of destruction and suffering, be it man-inflicted or natural. Since the Russian invasion in December 1979, Afghanistan has become a battleground of world superpowers and is surrounded by an unending wave of destruction.\n\nAfter the foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan, Pakistan hosted an exclusive Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference to discuss the Afghanistan issue. The conference focused on the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and exploring new avenues to address the rapidly worsening humanitarian situation in terms of food shortage and potential economic collapse. Foreign ministers of member countries, special invitees from the United Nations (UN), international financial institutions, and non-member states, including the US, UK, European Union, and Russia attended the session. Afghanistan’s delegation was headed by the acting foreign minister.\n\nPakistan’s initiative to host the 17th session of the emergency meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the OIC demonstrated Pakistan’s strong will to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan. All member countries unanimously agreed that peace and stability in the region can only be achieved by forming a broad-based and inclusive government that is representative of the entire Afghan society. \n\nDecades of conflict and instability in Afghanistan have left millions of people on the brink of starvation. Some 24 million Afghans were already in need of humanitarian assistance because of the economic crisis and lack of development aid. The situation was further exacerbated after the recent earthquake in Paktia and Khost, which left nearly 1,500 dead and many more injured. \n\nFollowing the earthquake, the Afghan government appealed for international support to address the crisis. The Pakistani government responded immediately by dispatching consignments of relief goods. On 22nd June, the first convoy of 8 trucks carrying tents, tarpaulin, and blankets from the National Disaster Management Authority reached Afghanistan. On 24th June, another consignment of relief assistance was sent through aircraft. Besides this, Pak-Afghan Cooperation Forum (PACF) also sent 5 trucks carrying 37.5 tons of food, winter bedding, tents, tarpaulins, and clothes. \n\nEarlier, PACF had also organised free eye camps in the hospitals in Kabul and Khost where thousands of Afghan patients were provided free treatment by Pakistani doctors. The forum also facilitated the first batch of Afghan children with congenital diseases who will receive free medical treatment in Pakistan. \n\nTo promote bilateral trade with Afghanistan, the Pakistani government decided to relax the visa policy to ensure long-term and sustainable trade between the two countries. Under the new policy, six months of multiple entry visas will be issued to transporters from Afghanistan. Pakistan has also decided to import coal from Afghanistan, which can help Pakistan generate cheaper electricity and save nearly $2.3 billion. \n\nSince August 2021, the economic crisis and collapse of the banking sector have made it extremely challenging to get money into Afghanistan. International humanitarian organisations and the UN have scaled up assistance to address rising needs, but aid cannot replace the services of the state. To institutionalise financial support, a trust fund was established at the OIC conference. However, the international community remains reluctant to allow cash inflow.\n\nDuring this difficult time, the international community must lift sanctions and release Afghan funds as the country has descended into a serious economic crisis. The international community must realise that this is not the time to settle scores or debate on issues of legitimacy or recognition. They must resume aid and support the Afghan people to mitigate their miseries. \n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 6th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Javed-Iqbal1659724580-1/Javed-Iqbal1659724580-1.jpg"}, {"headline": "Dialogue urged to end political uncertainty", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369231/dialogue-urged-to-end-political-uncertainty", "date_published": "Wed, 03 Aug 22 07:47:41 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tChief of Qaumi Watan Party (QWP), Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao on Tuesday while showing concern over current political state of affairs, suggested a grand dialogue for all political par-\nties to ease the situation.\n\nTalking to media persons, Aftab Sherpao said if a grand dialogue among political entities was not held, it would be harmful for the country and its economy.\n\nSuggesting two resolutions to end wrangling between the political parties, Sherpao said in politics the doors of negotiations and dialogue were never kept closed.\n\nHe said if Hasina Wajid and Khaleda Zia could sit on one table in Bangladesh for the sake of their country, then why the government and opposition in Pakistan cannot have reconciliation dialogue.\n\nHe said the political mercury which has touched the new heights of confrontation needed to be brought down through talks.\n\nThe confronting politics, he said, have also badly hit the country’s economy that was a matter of great concern and must be understood by the politicians.

Recently, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the Padma Bridge and declared it a ‘symbol of pride and capacity’. As early as 1992, Sheikh Hasina was involved in the economic issues and plans for Bangladesh. She undertook the task of balancing economic policies with political implications. Sheikh Hasina shifted focus from her father’s socialist agenda toward market-based capitalist growth. She learnt from other Asian countries whose economic success was based upon four pillars: political stability, social development, trade liberalisation with export-led growth and fiscal restraint.\n\nDuring a conference, when an economist began informing her about the benefits of trade liberalisation, Sheikh Hasina quipped, “you don’t have to convince me about trade liberalisation. When I was living with my physicist husband in the Italian city of Trieste on the Yugoslavian border, I watched the border being opened three times a week and people travelling across from both sides, purchasing goods and return.” This demonstrates that Sheikh Hasina was assiduously focused on economics rather than other considerations that politicians are attracted to. \n\nEven though between 1971 to 2009, Bangladesh had hiccups in accountability campaigns and military rule, since 2009, the army has taken the back seat. Bangladesh has seen less frequent derailment of civilian governments and experienced little legitimisation and delegitimization of governments. Although its democratic history is not untainted, Bangladesh’s government has largely avoided public criticism about corruption and inefficiency. Despite having little experience in governance, the Prime Minister possessed visionary acuity and conviction that economic progress was the only way to alleviate poverty in the country. \n\nAlthough marred by allegations of coercion of opponents, after over fifteen years of sustained growth, Bangladesh has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Back in 1970, the country was 75% poorer compared to Pakistan but now it is 45% richer. In 1970, it had 10 million more mouths to feed but now its population is 170 million compared to Pakistan’s 230 million. In 2021, Bangladesh’s exports were $47 billion while Pakistan’s exports were $28 billion. The income per capita in Bangladesh is $2,227 compared to Pakistan’s $1,543. In 2022, its gross domestic product (GDP) is $411 billion compared to the $347 billion in Pakistan. The annual inflation rate is 6% compared to Pakistan’s previous 12-15%, which has now risen to 21% and is expected to further increase. Also, the Bangladeshi taka is much stronger compared to the Pakistani rupee. Importantly, Bangladesh has a strong literacy rate with high female participation in the economy.\n\nIn Pakistan, political parties have remained interested in personal gains. The repeated manipulation of the democratic process has stymied the growth of strong, democratic, and non-dynastic parties. It is worth recognising that economic growth is closely tied with political stability, rule of law, strong civilian institutions, and participatory democracy. Pakistan inherited an overdeveloped state with a feeble bourgeoise linked in a patron-client relationship with a powerful state. The country has inevitably witnessed an economic and political evolution marked by privilege and patronage. Agriculture and business incomes are primarily excluded from the tax net. There is an absence of progressive wealth tax and huge industrial and estate complexes are exempt from any levies. Our parliament is dominated by landlords, it is a small wonder that agriculture income tax has been relegated as an inconsequential subject to the provincial domain. Consequently, the tax net remains small as agriculture and industrial sectors are undertaxed.\n\nSince 1958, all experiments with the government have augmented feudal power instead of empowering the masses. The growth path pursued in Pakistan has been skewed in favour of the privileged, rich, and elite who must now make their fair contribution to the state. \n\nFollowing Bangladesh’s example, Pakistani leadership must pursue economic growth as the national agenda and adopt constitutionalism along with regional peace. Without compromising viable defence, adequate resources must be released for social and economic development. Considering that regional avenues of growth necessitate trade liberalisation, foreign trade agreements must be formed with India, Iran, China, Afghanistan, and other trading partners. Also, the export-led growth model should refocus on high-value-added goods.\n\nPakistan enjoys a comparative advantage in cheaper labour, which must be transformed to improve skills and productivity. Education and technical training for women must be promoted and adopted widely to increase women’s participation in the workforce. Also, a safe and legally conducive environment is crucial for foreign investments. \n\nA serious effort is required to levy a fair tax on agricultural incomes and the rich industrial cartels must make their due contribution to national wealth. Besides wealth and death taxes, large corporate and estate sectors need to be brought into the tax net.\n\nPakistan’s leadership can learn many lessons from Bangladesh’s experience, but the main takeaway should be that Sheikh Hasina prioritised economic growth, which is crucial for both defence and democracy.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 2nd, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Sahibzada-Riaz-Noor1655837455-1/Sahibzada-Riaz-Noor1655837455-1.jpg"}, {"headline": "A stitch in time", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368349/a-stitch-in-time", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Jul 22 19:56:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhen Imran Khan first came to power, he repeatedly lamented the insufficient political space to pursue his promised agenda. PTI was new to governance and struggled to find direction. This found comparisons with other governance models mostly bordering on unchecked power and singular control. The closest we come to it in a democracy is the presidential form but it sits against the ethos of a parliamentary governance model — more popularly accepted given our peculiar political environment. Legislation and parliamentary support for substantial reform stood unattended and PTI’s agenda remained undelivered. That was the moment to return to the electorate for a new mandate through a snap, mid-term or early election. He dithered and stalled till the chips fell. And then it was too late.\n\nToday the nation and the state is at a cross-road and most paths lead out to further disaster than seen in the last six months. It may be politics to those engaged in it but it spells life and death for a nation. There hasn’t been a more precarious moment in our national history. Politics, so used to arbitration, isn’t finding one at the moment — so controversial have the traditional points of mediation turned. The army and its leadership was maligned at will for the most part of the last six years. Any insinuation of the army’s leadership amounts to deliberate subversion, sedition and disruption in the military order. It is now a daily fodder. That the military politicised itself so much as to be a fair game is something for it to ponder over and deal with; but in a country where institutions have had to lend a hand in governance, their need to arbitrate when politicians feud will never go away. With such malicious and vicious attacks on it, the military has been literally neutralised.\n\nMaking courts controversial is the next ploy. The focus is on subverting the judiciary in public non-cooperation to contrive decisions of a side’s liking. A political system’s inability to resolve its own predicaments means that courts are asked to arbitrate. They are then framed for activism and judicial coups in public narrative when decisions don’t go their way. This is patent blackmail. In an environment where the economy is on the verge of crashing, if not already crashed, the threat of a default looms, 120 million people of Punjab have been without a functioning government for the last four months at the hands of political shenanigan-ism, the military is fighting a rear-guard action against terrorism in its midst, and the international environment is tenuous, fragile and laden against us politically and economically, governance is a non-functioning entity while politics is at best fratricidal and predatory. Those responsible for each of these, fiddle instead in crass opportunistic entanglement. There isn’t an institution left that has not been tarnished. So complete is the insinuation and slander. The crisis meanwhile only deepens and engorges us from all sides.\n\nThere are four possible ways-out from the current predicament:\n\n1) There can be a reset of the entire thing as has been the traditional resort when the army intervened and installed a transitional government after it had stalled into inaction. It has always left serious negative consequences to politics and governance in the country and skewed the balance of power unfairly. In the army itself the effects are substantively adverse and distasteful to its own professional culture. It is best avoided.\n\n2) The courts may declare a state of mis-governance in the country and an absence of a government that strictly conforms to the legal, constitutional and moral mandate to claim power. It may then emplace a national government composed of both political and non-political technocrats to fill-in for a period of 6 months to a year to reform and reset what has become broken in the normal course of things resulting in political stagnation. Historically, political classes have manipulated constitutional and legal statutes in their favour. Politics has also tended to corrupt the judicial system through inducement or fear of retribution or manipulation through parliamentary power to proverbially cut the wings of what is perceived a largely independent judiciary — a sine qua non in a democratic state. This option may seem appealing given our state of disorder and institutional break-down, though political parties for the most part will play spoilers to this arrangement by disassociating and disowning the reform process. Arbitrating structures must find a way to engage with political structures to make them a willing part of the process. A constitutional protection will be needed to safeguard any statutory recourse for making governance more sustainable and consistent.\n\n3) The third option is the Sri Lankan way. When the control of the government and its capacity to govern melted away, the only remaining power was that of the people on the streets. Law enforcement agencies could only do so much in the initial stages of the uprising but as soon as it got bigger and voluminous, law enforcement drew back to avoid bloodshed against its own citizens. The option engenders anarchy and chaos, and fragments a nation’s and a society’s core ethos as well as its physical and structural pillars. A nation may then dissolve and a state may cease to exist. In a nuclear-capable nation, it remains unthinkable and will invite intervention, even external. Although Imran Khan has waved this bogey often in a hope to elicit institutional support in favour of his political objectives, it remains a red-flag event needing constant monitoring. Khan has been very poorly and insidiously advised to use this option as a ploy. We have enough political and moral acumen in the country to save us from such a disastrous consequence.\n\n4) Our polity, so used to external arbitration, perhaps needs it the most in current times. It stands dysfunctional and polarised to the point of rupture. Seemingly there exists little possibility for political players to come together in consensus on critical issues. Such is the intensity and depth of the divide. Yet it remains the only saviour out of our debilitating predicament. The President, the army, and the judiciary will need to come together at this precarious moment beyond their respective constitutional domains to avoid a multi-sectoral meltdown of the state and the nation. The agreed mechanism in the 1973 constitution continues to be either subverted or manipulated for political favour, forcing resort to the judiciary for adjudication. Necessary tweaking of laws and statutes may be needed in a consensus to enable sustainable, resilient, transparent and effective governance both at the center and in the provinces. Early elections and a new mandate are essential for a credible government to carry an effective voice with multilateral and bilateral partners.\n\nA half derelict non-concern for a free-falling economy by the government seems more a ploy to keep the powers-that-be interested in rushing the props to keep the government in place. Such purposed neglect is insidious and needs immediate redressal. We cannot sit idly by as negative politics unravels the order. A stitch in time will save us some more.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 29th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Shahzad-Chaudhry1592677757-0/Shahzad-Chaudhry1592677757-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan pulls out of India chess event", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368293/pakistan-pulls-out-of-india-chess-event", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Jul 22 06:50:07 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan have withdrawn from the world's biggest international chess tournament in protest at hosts India holding a torch relay for the event through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Thursday.\n\nThe 44th Chess Olympiad will see over 1,700 players from 188 nations compete in Chennai from now until August 10.\n\nThe last two competitions were played virtually because of the pandemic.\n\nThe Kashmir dispute has weathered decades of violence and upheaval since it was partitioned between India and Pakistan when both countries became independent in 1947.\n\nThe neighbours both claim it in full and have fought two of their three wars over control of the territory.\n\n\"By passing the torch relay through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir...

And yet, the military-industrial complex continues to thrive, elite capture remains elusive, and the juggernaut of divisive politics continues to cause fissures in our cultural zeitgeist. A colossal amount of black money — Pakistan’s illegitimate parallel economy — remains unseen, unreported and untaxed. Whether we are a police officer or a judge, a petty officer or a general, a building contractor or a factory owner, we continue to lie, cheat and defraud others and our country on our way to achieving our goals. Our economy and our morality both are on the cusp of default. As a society, we cannot stoop lower.\n\nIf there is one trait that defines political leadership like none other, it is narcissism. In our frenzied political landscape, knocking at the door of the Supreme Court has become an obsessive-compulsive ritual. If our politicians don’t get what they want, they are quick to approach the highest bench. Regardless of which party they belong to, if the judges rule in their favour, they are hailed as honest and impartial; if the judgements go against them, the same judges are deemed as partial and biased.\n\nOn July 22, a letter was waved once again, this time in the chamber of the Punjab Assembly. This time, it was the Hamza-Elahi face-off. We were back to watching television news shows where uncouth tirades were interrupted by even more uncouth tirades hurled by so-called political pundits. But here is the gist of the problem: legal discussions on the constitutionality of a matter are enlightening, they’re a thing of beauty; but when polluted by partisanship, these same discussions lose their intellectual value.\n\nWhy are politicians so obsessed with hanging on to power? The answer lies in the question itself: power. And this brings me to the power paradox which simply means that we act with empathy and modesty at first but quickly turn to coercion, manipulation and exploitation as soon as we acquire power. Whether we are corporate executives or CEOs, monarchs or political leaders, or even patriarchs in a patriarchal society, the power paradox applies to all of us. Inherent within us is a proclivity for pathological addiction to power, vanity and self-importance.\n\nIs greed a precursor to the power paradox? Is greed the driving force for success? Gordon Grekko, a character played by Michael Douglas in the movie Wall Street, puts it bluntly when he says, “the point is ladies and gentlemen that greed is, for lack of a better word, good.” The fact remains that we are rats in a rat race. Greed feeds our egos. Greed also divides us between the haves and the have-nots, between the exploiters and the exploited. Karl Marx was prophetic about our fate under capitalism: “Money is the universal, self-constituted value of all things. It has therefore robbed the whole world, human as well as natural, of its own values.”\n\nOut of hope or despair, we follow political leaders only to be ushered to the innermost circle of hell. On the one hand, we have political clans that remind us of the Sicilian mafia, the Cosa Nostra. On the other hand, we have a self-aggrandising braggart who shares a passing resemblance with Mussolini. We gather in thousands and listen to them deliver inspiring speeches just like Hitler did about a hundred years ago or Donald Trump more recently. They promise to save our country, to restore our lost glory, our greatness and excellence, while they make secret deals behind closed doors in the dead of the night.\n\nIn Botan Doro, a chilling ghost story, a handsome Japanese samurai falls in love with a beautiful girl carrying a lantern who visits his town every night but disappears before dawn.

Not that Pakistan has a history of clean politics but the present crisis especially in Punjab is extremely serious and is taking place when global and regional conditions are pitched against us.\n\nMore consequential is the fact that the country’s economy is in dire straits and the government is desperately seeking IMF and friendly countries to bail it out. Instead of focusing on the best use of scarce resources to satisfy the needs of the people, mismanagement is making matters worse. History seems to be repeating itself as both PTI and the PML-N-led coalition are seeking the support of the army leadership and putting pressure on the judiciary to tilt verdicts in their favour. Whatever tactics the government may employ to stay in power in Punjab and at the Center will only add to the misery of the silent majority, and strengthen the army’s leverage.\n\nImran Khan’s deliberate policy of ignoring democratic institutions and shunning the opposition defies the basic concept of pluralism and tends toward dictatorial instincts. When the entire political energy is geared towards demolishing the opponent instead of presenting oneself as a better candidate or party through performance, the political scenario can turn ugly very quickly. And this situation we are already witnessing. Besides, the prevalent policy of all political parties of blocking programs and initiatives that the previous government had initiated irrespective of country needs has to cease. By such inimical responses the worst affected are the ordinary people. It is unfortunate that the ruling party and the opposition are weakening the political structure and pursuing policies that undermine the economy and lower the image of the country. Moreover, such elite and party polarisation has filtered down at the grass-root level.\n\nIn all the main political parties — PML-N, PTI and PPP — there is excessive concentration of power in the top leadership that is preventing the advantage of making and implementing better policies that would have emerged otherwise from valuable input from the higher tier leadership where sufficient talent and experience resides. Unless political parties do not internally democratise, there is scant hope of improving the quality of democracy at the national, provincial and local levels. Moreover, when political parties have a mix of conservative and liberal, educated and experienced in sufficient numbers, politics of compromise and a certain level of decorum prevails. That seems a long way off and our present challenge is how to reduce the animosity and bitter rivalry among political parties. The flow of dirty money to influence political behaviour has become common place and politicians, instead of enacting laws and taking disciplinary action against the violators, are frequently promoting it. Checks and balances are already in our system but these are largely ignored. We have to work towards the goal to revive these, but to expect that our politicians in their present state of mind would be thinking along these lines would be day-dreaming. Can we also afford to give up and let the country continue to slide?\n\nAdding to our national woes is the adverse international environment. The Russia-US confrontation over Ukraine requires deft handling of foreign relations and the economy in which a better understanding and cooperation of major political parties is necessary. Due to accelerating global inflation and scarcity of basic essentials, especially of fuel, agricultural and industrial products, not only are the prices rapidly increasing but they are frequently becoming scarce. Unfortunately, there is hardly any realisation of these developments that is reflected in the political behaviour.\n\nThe US-China rivalry has also stepped up as President Biden has taken an aggressive posture toward China to dampen its fast-growing economy and influence in the coming years. Apart from its overall negative global fallout, it creates not only economic but also strategic restraints on Pakistan. It would remain a challenge for Pakistan diplomacy to steer this hostile terrain. While remaining steadfast in maintaining a strategic relationship with China, Pakistan should seek close relations with the US in terms of economy and trade. But, here too there is no serious thought being given apart from leaving it to our diplomats. Fortunately, we have highly professional and dedicated diplomats, and presently a competent Foreign Minister that is managing foreign policy astutely under trying conditions. What cannot be overlooked is that Pakistan’s foreign policy would carry weight when Pakistan is internally stable and its economy is strong.\n\nWhat is worrisome is that in this anarchic domestic situation, education, infrastructure, healthcare, and research and development are being ignored with serious consequences for the country’s future. The IT revolution and expansion of globalisation has been only partially absorbed. Leaders struggling for political survival are thinking and planning largely on a short horizon and neglecting these areas. This also has to do with the quality of the power structure and priorities that are driven by special or personal interests. Similarly, how many politicians are listening to the lone voice and warnings of Sherry Rehman on climate change and global warming. Or that of Raza Rabbani, Aitzaz Ahsan on wise political and constitutional issues. Successive government leaderships have been unwilling to open their minds to issues that are long-term, despite the reality that climate change is occurring right here largely due to human activities. There is an urgent need to give serious thought on how to respond to it and should invite interest across the political spectrum.\n\nBut despite the highly disturbing political and economic situation we are experiencing, it can all change provided some sanity among top political leadership prevails. Imran Khan has to lower his rhetoric, take serious issues to parliament and refrain from shaking the frail political structure. And the PDM coalition leadership should avoid political vendetta, take effective measures toward improving governance and lifting the economy while the clock is still ticking.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 27th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1083504-TalatMasoodNew-1460481455/1083504-TalatMasoodNew-1460481455.JPG"}, {"headline": "PM Shehbaz's son in the soup for 'incitement to violence' on Twitter", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2365432/pm-shehbazs-son-in-the-soup-for-incitement-to-violence-on-twitter", "date_published": "Sat, 09 Jul 22 11:12:07 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfter a Twitter account purportedly belonging to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's oldest son --- Suleman Sharif, urged his followers to \"toss shoes\" and \"name and shame\" a family that heckled Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal in a viral video on Friday, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf supporters heavily trolled the businessman's post and called for the account to be blocked for trying to incite violence.\n\n\n\nمیرے شیرو جہاں اس فیملی کو دیکھو۔ جوتے مارو۔ اس گنڈا گرد اور گنڈا لیڈر @ImranKhanPTI اور چورنی پیرنی نظر آئے 🦯 تیار رکھو۔ https://t.co/2srX5PMXJ9\n— Zi Suleman Sharif (@zi_suleman) July 8, 2022\n\n\nIqbal was targeted by PTI supporters as he stood in a queue waiting to place his order in a fast food joint at Bhera Interchange near Punjab's Sargodha.

But with many provinces across Pakistan witnessing unprecedented levels of rain, dengue could very well escalate into a national health crisis. This merits attention from the very top.\n\nSurveillance campaigns must be carried out across flood affected areas to identify and destroy breeding grounds.

Doctors have advised citizens to take precautions to avoid catching the disease during the current weather conditions.\n\nAccording to Ophthalmologist Dr Tahir Farooq, conjunctivitis is an eye infection that spreads rapidly from one person to another. “Generally, this infection gains momentum in the summer or rainy season. During moist weather conditions, conjunctivitis spreads very rapidly but it can be prevented by taking preventive measures,” he said.\n\nHe said that people must frequently wash hands and avoid hand-to-eye contact to keep eye infections at bay. \n\nThe doctor said that people should avoid rubbing their eyes with fingers as they contain germs and can lead to an infection. He said that people should not share towels, napkins etc as doing so can raise the risk of suffering from eye infections.\n\nNaveed Shams, a patient suffering from conjunctivitis, said that seven out of 11 persons in his house have fallen prey to conjunctivitis.\n\nPatients suffering from the disease feel severe irritation in their eyes and it becomes very difficult to open their eyes in the sunlight. “The patient's eyes become red and water starts discharging from the eyes. I have been visiting the doctor for the last three days, but I did not get any sort of relief,” he said adding that he was following the precautionary measures said by the doctor so that other members of his household would not catch the disease.\n\nAccording to the data obtained from three allied hospitals in Rawalpindi, the number of patients with conjunctivitis has increased in the rainy season as compared to normal days\n\nAs per statistics released by the three allied hospitals, 12 more patients suffering from conjunctivitis have landed in hospitals in the last 24 hours.\n\nEye disease expert Dr Mudassar said that conjunctivitis can also be caused by dust rising after the rain. He said that polluted air and excessive use of fast lighting devices were also the cause of this disease. \n\nHe said that citizens have to show responsibility to prevent the spread of conjunctivitis. He said that the water discharged from the patient's eyes is toxic and when a patient cleans it with his hands, it becomes infected and the disease could be transmitted to other people through shaking hands.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 18th, 2022.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1732991-eyesurgery_reuters-1528782738/1732991-eyesurgery_reuters-1528782738.jpg"}, {"headline": "Two cops killed in attack on polio team in Tank", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2371443/two-cops-killed-in-attack-on-polio-team-in-tank", "date_published": "Tue, 16 Aug 22 08:29:27 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tTwo policemen were killed in an attack on a polio team by armed men on Tuesday in the Tank district of ​​Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).\n\nAccording to the police, constables Pir Rehman and Nisar died in the shooting and their bodies have been shifted to the hospital.

In a globalised world, the internet is no longer a luxury.\n\n“The internet is one of the greatest inventions of all time,” said blogger and influencer Nouman Younus. It has changed our lives in so many ways and is making life easier for us. “We can communicate with people from anywhere in the world, share our thoughts, get inspired by other people's ideas, learn new things and much more.”\n\n“Internet is an important service that sustains our digital age,” said Soban Khan, a first-year student of BS computer sciences. “Internet has been a source of information and communication globally. This connectivity enables people to communicate with each other across the globe.”\n\nThe internet was a large network of computers, according to Khan. It was also a network of networks, which were connected together in a web-like configuration. “The internet is made up of many other networks, each with its own purpose and function — some for hosting websites, others for government agencies and businesses, he said.\n\nAnd then there are those who use it simply to connect with other people around the world.\n\nThe internet had been used for numerous purposes, said Nouman Younus. “Students can use the internet to access information and resources, as well as communicate with other classmates, he added.\n\n“It is also used for social purposes. People use the internet to connect with others and share ideas that may not be shared offline, such as through social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter.”\n\nPeople used the internet to watch videos about the subjects they were interested in, listen to music that matches their taste, play games or read books online, said Soban Khan.\n\n“The internet has become an indispensable part of our life. It is used for entertainment, communication, education and work. It is also used for banking, shopping and healthcare as well as research.”\n\nRead more: Heavy rains, floods cause internet outages in Pakistan\n\nAccording to Nouman Younus, the internet revolutionised the way business was being done these days. “It has made it easier for people to start a business from home. If you have an idea, you do not need to wait until you get out of college or after graduating from college because there are many sites that can help you get started with your own business,\" he said, pointing out that this was the reason why we are seeing the young generation beginning to earn much earlier compared to previous generations.\n\n“It has made it easier for people to find information about a product or service,” he said.\n\n“This means that instead of having only one source of information, like magazines or newspapers – which sometimes don't cover everything – consumers now have access through various sources such as blogs and social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook,” he added.\n\n“This allows them not just to learn more about something but also give feedback on their thoughts about what should happen next and the companies could improve their products on the basis of the feedback.”\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/internet1597032111-0/internet1597032111-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "US lawmakers unveil bill to help news media negotiate with Google, Facebook", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372714/us-lawmakers-unveil-bill-to-help-news-media-negotiate-with-google-facebook", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 08:59:39 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tA bipartisan group of US lawmakers on Monday released a revised version of a bill aimed at making it easier for news organizations to negotiate collectively with platforms like Google and Facebook.\n\nThe Journalism Competition and Preservation Act \"removes legal obstacles to news organization's ability to negotiate collectively and secure fair terms from gatekeeper platforms that regularly access news content without paying for its value,\" according to a news release from the lawmakers.\n\nThe group includes Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican Senator John Kennedy, both members of the Judiciary Committee, and House Judiciary Committee members David Cicilline, a Democrat, and Ken Buck, a Republican.\n\nA previous version of the bill, introduced in March 2021, was opposed by two technology industry trade groups that Meta Platforms' Facebook and Alphabet's  Google belong to - the Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice.\n\nThe updated bill would cover news publishers with fewer than 1,500 full-time employees and non-network news broadcasters.

Its share price closed up over 5% on the news on Tuesday.\n\nThe talks come as strained Sino-U.S. relations exacerbate sensitivities over technology transfer and data handling across borders, prompting tech firms to reappraise their operations in China. At the same time, there is growing interest in expanding game-making software to new technologies such as the so-called metaverse, an immersive three-dimensional internet.\n\nUnity entered China in 2012 and its eponymous software, known as a game engine, powers many of the country's most popular games such as \"Honor of Kings\" from gaming leader Tencent Holdings Ltd and miHoYo's \"Genshin Impact\".\n\nRivals include Tencent-backed Epic Games, the U.S. developer of the increasingly popular Unreal Engine 5.\n\nUnity's spin-off plan is being driven by a desire to see its software used more extensively in China in areas as varied as smart city modelling to industrial design, as well as in the metaverse, two of the people said. Potential investors Unity has been speaking to have made big bets on the metaverse, they said.\n\nWith China tightening data handling regulations, Unity believes a spin-off would aid this expansion as it would give the unit more local ownership and autonomy over how it operates in the country, which could also increase its attraction to local government and state-owned partners, the people said.\n\nThe spin-off would be one of China's bigger technology deals this year as investment activity has slowed due to weak economic growth, COVID-19 outbreaks and regulatory tightening.\n\nUnity China Chief Executive Zhang Junbo has been working on the plan for at least a year, two of the people said. Progress has been further slowed by Unity's share price sinking 80% since its November 2021 high amid weakness in U.S. tech stocks, and by a product missing performance expectations, they said.\n\nZhang disclosed Unity's China expansion ambition last month to local tech media outlet 36Kr without mentioning a spin-off, saying Unity was exploring ways to make its technology \"safe and controllable\" within China - a reference to the government's mandate for important technology to be controlled domestically.\n\nHe also said Unity would likely hire over a thousand engineers in coming years while expanding offices in Beijing and Guangzhou in addition to its main office in Shanghai.\n\nTwo of the people said Unity's Shanghai-based employees have been asked to sign contracts with the new entity, and that talks about an operating budget separate to its parent's are ongoing.\n\nA local joint venture (JV) could help Unity \"gain a footing with sensitive industries such as governments and manufacturing that are seeking to modernise their operations with digital twins and real-time 3D enabled technologies,\" said Matthew Kanterman, director of research at Ball Metaverse Research Partners.\n\nWhile forming a China JV carries risk - a notable example being a dispute between British chipmaker Arm and its Chinese unit - Kanterman said such JVs have worked well for many Western tech firms, such as HP Inc and Nokia Oyj.\n\n\"Having the right local partners can help Unity succeed where others struggle,\" Kanterman said.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2166077-gaming-1582884808/2166077-gaming-1582884808.jpg"}, {"headline": "Samsung Galaxy S23 could be the most powerful phone ever", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369816/samsung-galaxy-s23-could-be-the-most-powerful-phone-ever", "date_published": "Sat, 06 Aug 22 07:30:22 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSamsung Galaxy S23 could be the most powerful phone ever once it launches next year.

Cyber-terrorists and state-sponsored hackers are the key actors in cyber-war, who not only attack websites to deface them and steal Facebook accounts, but also compromise and destroy our country's economic security.\n\nA malware agent used in a cyberattack for military, paramilitary, or intelligence purposes is usually referred to as a cyberweapon. Data theft and electronic or physical destruction are examples of cyber weapons. While a cyberweapon nearly always causes direct or indirect financial harm to the target organization, direct financial gain for the sponsor is not the primary goal of this type of agent.\n\nA cyber-army is a group of troops with advanced cyber talents who are extremely competent in information technology. Countries should use cyber-armies to maintain national cybersecurity. China is ranked first in cyber defensive power, followed by the Netherlands and France, then the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the United States leads in cyber offensive, cyber norms influence, and cyber intelligence. Teams at Cyber Command are allocated to specific adversaries — including Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China — and have worked with the intelligence community for years to get access to digital networks. Cyberweapons are stealth weapons that, like any computer code, are written in zeros and ones. They have the ability to infiltrate entire networks as well as infect individual PCs. They have the ability to block communication systems, confound enemy signals, and stop military attacks before they happen, all without the flash and bang of traditional weapons of war.\n\nAlthough cyber warfare is a new phenomenon in its current form, the notion is as old as warfare itself. Rivals used to try to physically interrupt their opponent's communication networks in the old days as well. Similarly, using all available means, well-thought-out strategies were used to gain access to information systems and develop mechanisms of misinformation in enemy ranks.\n\nHumans are becoming increasingly reliant on technology due to rapid advancements in communication tool applications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the efficacy of these technical techniques was put to the test. Even the most advanced states with cutting-edge medical facilities were crippled for months, forcing everyone from executives to administrative staff to work digitally from their homes.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of cyber threats has muddled the internal and external dimensions of national security, allowing less powerful state and non-state actors to increase their influence efforts. One of the causes that have fostered the formation of hybrid threats or made irregular warfare more appealing is the shifting nature of traditional ideas of armed conflict and war, because these may not motivate military action.\n\nDue to its great capacity to disrupt communication infrastructure, cyberwarfare is now regarded as a more appropriate tactic for offensive action against a rival. This is particularly risky because it has the potential to immobilize the target system for the duration of the disruption. Highly sensitive defense installations, such as command and control systems, missile-firing sites, air defense systems, and, more importantly, strategic decision-making mechanisms, may be included in these systems.\n\nThe race for space dominance, which began in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik-I by the then-Soviet Union and ended in 1958 with the launch of the United States' first manned space voyage, was perhaps to attain improved connectedness, integration, and networking in the decades to come. However, knowledge gained via advancements in the fields of information and space technology is now being used in a bad way to disrupt the same communication and integration.\n\nState institutions have become increasingly vulnerable as a result of the use of cyber warfare as part of a strategy to disrupt enemy lines of communication and cause harm to their prospective capabilities. Personal security, which is an important component of human security, is also vulnerable to disruptions in communication, location, and financial activities, to name a few examples. As a result, international and national organizations must establish legal procedures to ensure that cyber warfare does not violate an individual's rights or deprive him or her of his or her financial assets. \n\nCyber-warfare tools used by the military could eventually fall into the hands of hackers. According to Interpol Secretary General Jurgen Stock, in a few years, state-developed cyberweapons will be available on the darknet, a hidden area of the internet that cannot be accessed using search engines like Google.\n\n\"In the physical world, that is a significant problem—we have weapons that are used on the battlefield today and will be utilized by organized crime groups tomorrow. The same is true for digital weapons that are currently in use by the military, have been created by the military, and will be available to criminals tomorrow.\"\n\nRansomware, in which hackers lock down a company's computer systems and demand a ransom payment to regain control, is one of the most common cyberweapons. Cyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nCyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Moscow has been blamed for a number of cyberattacks that occurred before and during its military invasion of Ukraine, but it has always denied the allegations. Meanwhile, Ukraine has solicited the assistance of volunteer hackers from all around the world to aid in its defense against Russian aggression. A \"significant number\" of cyberattacks go unnoticed. \"It's not just law enforcement that demands we develop bridges between our silos, the islands of information,\" says the author. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Cybersecurity Outlook study, the number of cyberattacks worldwide more than doubled in 2021. According to the research, ransomware remains the most common sort of assault, with firms being targeted 270 times each year on average. Critical energy infrastructure and supply lines are being jeopardized by cyberattacks. \n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/top-view-unrecognizable-hacker-performing-cyberatt1659791000-0/top-view-unrecognizable-hacker-performing-cyberatt1659791000-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Future Fest founder Arzish Azam represents Pakistan at BSV Global Blockchain Convention in Dubai", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2359364/future-fest-founder-arzish-azam-represents-pakistan-at-bsv-global-blockchain-convention-in-dubai", "date_published": "Tue, 31 May 22 15:40:56 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfter the success of Future Fest 2022 on May 13-15 in Islamaba, Arzish Azam was invited to represent Pakistan as a speaker at BSV Global Blockchain Convention at Grand Hyatt Dubai held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Saud bin Saqr al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council – Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah.\n\nFuture Fest is the largest tech conference of expo of Pakistan, attended by big web3 companies such as Binance, Epic Games, Kucoin, BitOasis and BSV.

This part of Section 497(1) CrPC which prohibits the grant of bail in certain offences is popularly known as the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\"\n\nHowever, the order said that the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC provides that the court may direct that any person under the age of sixteen years or any woman or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be released on bail.\n\nThe expression “such an offence” used in this proviso refers to the offence mentioned in the second part (prohibitory clause) of Section 497(1) CrPC, as for all other non-bailable offences the court is already empowered to release the accused on bail under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nThe first proviso has thus made equal the power of the court to grant bail in the offences of prohibitory clause alleged against an accused under the age of sixteen years, a woman accused and a sick or infirm accused, to its power under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\n\"This means that in cases of women, etc., as mentioned in the first proviso to Section 497(1), irrespective of the category of the offence, bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as an exception in the same manner as it is granted or refused in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nExceptions\n\nThe apex court also noted that the exceptions for refusing bail in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC are therefore also applicable to the accused who pray for bail under the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC in an offence falling within the prohibitory clause.\n\n“These exceptions are well settled by several judgements of this court. They are the likelihood of the accused: (a) to abscond to escape trial; (b) to tamper with the prosecution evidence or influence the prosecution witnesses to obstruct the course of justice; or (c) to repeat the offence keeping in view his previous criminal record, nature of the offence or the desperate manner in which he has prima facie acted in the commission of the offence.\"\n\nRegarding the case in hand, the bench noted that they do not find any material that would attract any of the above exceptions in order to refuse bail to the present petitioner.\n\n\"We are cognizant of the fact that the persons involved in the commission of offences of robbery or dacoity are usually professional criminals and there is a likelihood that they would repeat the offence if enlarged on bail. But the case of the present petitioner is distinguishable as she was working as a maid in the house of the complainant as per his own version, therefore, she does not appear to be a professional robber or dacoit and we do not find a likelihood of her repeating the offence if released on bail.\"\n\n\"The impugned order passed by the high court is, thus, not sustainable under the law and calls for interference by this Court. This petition is, therefore, converted into appeal and the same is allowed: the impugned order is set aside and the petitioner is admitted to post-arrest bail subject to her furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.\"\n\nThe court also noted that concession of bail may be cancelled by the competent court under Section 497(5) CrPC, if the petitioner misuses it in any manner, including causing a delay in the expeditious conclusion of the trial.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/SC1652779579-0/SC1652779579-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "PTI request in Toshakhana reference rejected", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372689/pti-request-in-toshakhana-reference-rejected", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:39:57 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday rejected PTI’s plea to grant a three-week time to provide documents in the reference seeking disqualification of party chief Imran Khan for not sharing details of Toshakhana gifts, directing it to submit the same within a week.\n\nPTI chief Imran Khan’s counsel Barrister Gohar appeared before the ECP on Monday as a five-member commission headed by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja heard the reference.\n\nBarrister Khalid Ishaq appeared before the bench on behalf of the coalition government while petitioner Mohsin Nawaz Ranjha represented PML-N.\n\nAt the outset of the hearing, the PTI counsel insisted that the party needed at least three weeks to gather and furnish the documents relating to the declaration of assets.\n\n“We are reviewing whether someone has declared iPhone and watches in his assets declaration or not,” the counsel told the bench.\n\nHe further explained that since the ECP had to wrap up the case in three months, the party would rather submit its answer in tandem with another in a similar reference seeking Imran's disqualification.\n\nAt this, the CEC remarked that the PTI would nonetheless still have the documents disclosed in the ECP's report.\n\nHowever, Barrister Gohar Khan contended that PML-N's petitioner Mohsin Nawaz Ranjha should also submit the statements pertaining to his party's declaration of assets.\n\nChiming in, the petitioner replied that the failure of other parties to disclose their assets did not provide Imran Khan \"a licence to his assets\".\n\nThe hearing was then adjourned until August 29.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/ECP1640860350-0/ECP1640860350-0.jpeg"}, {"headline": "Lahore to Quetta train service suspended", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372688/lahore-to-quetta-train-service-suspended", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:39:32 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Pakistan Railways has suspended the train service between Sindh and Balochistan for the next two to three days, as rains and flash floods have inundated railway tracks and damaged bridges, officials said on Monday.\n\n“Our tracks and yards have been affected in Sindh and Balochistan due to heavy rains.

Likewise, when the FIR is registered then the court should also initiate a contempt proceedings or not.\n\nThe Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday decided to initiate contempt proceedings against Imran Khan for passing controversial remarks regarding female sessions court judge Zeba Chaudhry.\n\nAt a rally in Islamabad’s F-9 park on Saturday, Imran had threatened to file cases against Islamabad’s inspector general (IG) of police and deputy inspector general (DIG) of police and declared: “We won’t spare you.” He then warned the judiciary against its “biased” attitude towards his party, saying that it should brace itself for the consequences.\n\nThis is not the first time the court is taking up a contempt matter against Imran. However, the PTI chief has managed to secure relief in such cases.\n\nIn 2013, the top court had summoned cricketer-turned-politician Imran for a contempt hearing over his \"critical and derogatory\" remarks against the judiciary.\n\nImran, who had by then made a major breakthrough in the general election, had allegedly said that the polls were rigged and criticised the judiciary and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not taking notice.\n\n\"While holding press conference on 26.7.2013, he (Khan) stated that the role of judiciary and Election Commission of Pakistan is shameful in the conduct of general elections; that the elections were rigged, due to role played by these two institutions,\" the apex court’s notice read.\n\nHowever, in a major relief for Imran, the Supreme Court decided to drop contempt proceedings on the suggestion of the then attorney general for Pakistan Muneer A Malik.\n\nA three-member bench headed by Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali discharged the notice after hearing the arguments of AGP Munir in the case who said that it is not the matter of disobedience.\n\nThe judgment said that admittedly, Imran Khan is a public figure and duly elected member of the National Assembly who has not only been actively involved in politics for a considerable period, but also heads a political party.\n\n\"In such circumstances, while considering his conduct, we also cannot lose sight of the provision of Articles-19 and 66 of our Constitution, relating to freedom of speech and the privileges of members of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament).”\n\n\"Thus, at this juncture, as a note of caution, we may observe that politicians and other public figures having their say and a following amongst the public are expected to use more decent and guarded language and have to be more careful in the selection of words in public gatherings or press conferences so as to show their intellect, maturity of mind and wisdom qua respect to various national institutions, and to present themselves as role models for the society at large,” the judgement noted.\n\nSimilarly, earlier this year, the Supreme Court refused to initiate contempt proceedings against the PTI chief over the non-implementation of its May 25 order.\n\nThe apex court had issued clear instructions to hold its Azadi March protest near Peshawar Mor between the H-9 and G-9 areas of Islamabad. However, Imran and his protestors did make their way toward D-Chowk, prompting the government to call in the Pakistan Army for the security of the capital's Red Zone.\n\nThe apex court had formed a five-member larger bench, headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, to hear the application filed by Attorney General of Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf.\n\nHowever, SC Judge Justice Yahya Afridi, while dissenting with the majority order, observed that a contempt proceeding should be initiated against PTI chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan for instructing party activists and supporters to proceed toward D-Chowk in violation of the SC's May 25 order.\n\nHe noted that there was sufficient material before the SC to initiate a contempt proceeding against Imran Khan over violation of the May 25 order and instructed the party activists and supporters to proceed toward D-Chowk.\n\nHowever, instead of issuing a contempt notice, the majority judges on June 1 sought reports from director generals of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) as well as Islamabad IG police, interior secretary and others over the alleged involvement of PTI leaders in instigating party workers to reach Islamabad's D-Chowk in violation of its May 25 order.\n\nLater the court was apprised by the law enforcement agencies that a “crowd was organised to enter Red Zone under the PTI leadership who had reached Express Chowk with the intent to proceed further towards D-Chowk as per the directions of the party’s highest command”.\n\nThe matter is still pending in the apex court.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/court-hammer1658069967-0/court-hammer1658069967-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Administrative issues jack up NHA project costs", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372681/administrative-issues-jack-up-nha-project-costs", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 04:15:58 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe cost of 33 National Highway Authority (NHA) projects has increased from Rs79.5 billion in 2008 to Rs90.73 billion in 2021 due to non-availability of funds and delay in land acquisition.\n\nAccording to the documents available with The Express Tribune, between 2008 and 2021, 33 projects of the authority were completed at cost overruns.

My enthusiasm was further bolstered by the welcome board en route to Makkah which stated “Guests of Ar-Rahman, your safety is our responsibility”.\n\n\n\nOn July 7th, I joined the one million pilgrims – 1.5 million less than in 2019 – in Minna. This was the largest Hajj gathering since the pandemic had forced numbers to 10,000 Muslims in 2020 and 60,000 Muslims in 2021. Suffice to say, all eyes were on the Kingdom. This year’s Hajj also coincided with 100 years of Saudi Arabia’s organising of the annual pilgrimage. Hajj 1443 was made all the more special since it coincided with a Friday, making it Hajj-e-Akbar.\n\n\n\nCompared to my previous experience, the zeal among the pilgrims seemed somewhat diminished. At first, I believed these to be misapprehensions given the reduced numbers. However, increased interaction with my companions made me realise that the pandemic, circumventing all biases, had been hard on everyone regardless of stature. Without a doubt, Covid-19 has broken each and every one of us in some way. The white barrier between the Kabbah and pilgrims was a reinforcing testament to the ‘new normal’ we have all been forced to adopt.\n\n\n\nFrom my past encounters, I was on the lookout for miracles. And I was not disappointed. A friend had related that the people of Makkah claim that clouds provide shade to the Hujjaj. I witnessed this first hand on the Day of Arafat – considered the apex of Hajj – during which unexpected clouds started forming in a previously clear sky, thereby making it tolerable to sit outside in the 44-degree heat. The same happened during the rest of the pilgrimage days. Each ritual reaffirmed what I had grown up hearing: “Hajj sabr ka naam hai” (Hajj is the name of patience), which further reinforces the South African phrase “Umuntu Ngumuntu Ngabantu” (I am because of what we all are). This feeling, I believe now, is a miracle in itself.\n\n\n\nIn line with their Vision 2030, this year, the Kingdom had undertaken many experiments and introduced many changes, with mixed results. A major issue was for those journeying from America, Europe and Australia who had to apply for Hajj using an online portal. There was a lack of clarity in the draw process and mix ups, as a result of which, many people were turned back from the airport.\n\nHowever, this is not to take away from the many improvements I witnessed. In keeping with their national rejuvenation plans, the Saudis had increased the application of modern technology by harnessing the best electronic devices available. This included the “In your languages, we welcome you” campaign, which aims at guiding the pilgrims in 23 languages. This highlighted increased inclusivity and accommodation of pilgrims which I had previously not witnessed.\n\n\n\nA robot introduced in the Grand Mosque, Makkah to distribute Qurans to worshipers.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable sights for me was to see Hajjis zooming along on electric scooters. As a trial service, the Saudi Public Authority for Transport provided pilgrims with this service to help ease the time taken between Holy sites. For instance, the usually one-hour walk between Arafat to Muzdalifah was reduced to just 15 minutes. This is in addition to the Saudi Hajj Ministry’s adoption of smart technologies to help assure comfort of the Hajjis.\n\n\n\nBy the same token, there were visibly increased numbers of security officials and scouts to aid the pilgrims not only during the rituals but also in and around the Holy Mosques. Another marked change was the greater role of the youth in all areas of pilgrim assistance; be it spraying water on the pilgrims to provide relief from the heat or medics and security personnel.\n\nSimilarly, even though on previous visits I had noticed the expanding role of women in workplaces in the country, this time around it was very distinct. Now there were uniformed women officers inside the Mosque, women volunteers at the airport and even women administering passenger data input. These tasks had previously been reserved for men alone.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, after a two year international hiatus, Hajj 1443 was a success and a triumph for the Muslim ummah in the face of the trials and tribulations brought on by the pandemic. Restored, refreshed and recentered, I departed Madina airport, leaving a part of my soul in Makkah and a piece of my heart in the Prophet’s (PBUH) city.\n\n\nAll photos courtesy of the author.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1081507-HajjTawafKaabaAFP-1460156940/1081507-HajjTawafKaabaAFP-1460156940.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan and Iran: The potential for a great alliance", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97602/pakistan-and-iran-the-potential-for-a-great-alliance", "date_published": "Wed, 22 Jun 22 08:36:24 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMarred by sectarian violence, opposing interests, differing foreign policies and failed economic possibilities, Pakistan-Iran relations have soured throughout the years. As a result, Islamabad has seldom explored the possibility of deeper relations with its western neighbour.\n\nAlthough Pakistan and Iran co-operate on a multitude of different platforms and sectors, the degree of cooperation has often been tested, and a considerable amount of blame for this falls on Pakistan’s shoulders. Shackled by its external constraints, primarily in the form of American influence, the risk of Saudi alienation, and the sanctions on Iran, Pakistan has consistently remained reluctant to pursue deeper relations. Iran, on the other hand, has shown a willingness to strengthen bilateral ties, the chief example being the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline. Islamabad’s lack of interest has not gone unnoticed in Tehran.\n\nIndignant about Pakistan’s ambivalent foreign policy, Iran has sought a closer relationship with India, which has proven to be a resourceful and trustworthy partner. In direct competition with Pakistan’s Gwadar port, Indian support helped Iran mobilise Chabahar as a major oceanic port in the region. Furthermore, Indian influence in Iran has helped India to indirectly meet its nefarious interests against Pakistan, particularly vis-a-vis Balochistan and Southern Afghanistan. As a result, Islamabad’s lack of interest in seeking a meaningful relationship with Iran has weakened its overall influence and created a region where Pakistan is becoming increasingly cornered.\n\nHowever, the obstacles which once sought to hinder Pak-Iran relations are now beginning to wither away, paving the way for a potentially great alliance.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Pakistan faces when it comes to Iran is pressure from its ally, the United States (US). America has been explicitly vocal against any form of cooperation between Iran and Pakistan, and it is no secret that it has sabotaged numerous initiatives between the two nations. However, following the war in Ukraine, America has had a change of heart. With the threat of a severe energy crisis inexorably hitting the developed and developing world, America has confronted the situation by re-engaging with countries that it once had vowed to eschew.\n\nIn March 2022, after years of estrangement, a senior American delegation had a rare face-to-face meeting with the Nicolas Maduro government in Caracas, Venezuela, the world’s most oil-rich country. The meeting had a one-point agenda: replace Russian oil with Venezuelan oil. Similar energy-focused engagements with Libya have also been undertaken by the US. More interestingly, the Biden administration has felt the JCPOA agreement (Iran Nuclear Deal) should be revived to relieve Iran of its sanctions and benefit from its abundant gas and oil supplies. Talks in Vienna are already underway and major headway is being made, highlighting the possibility that a deal could once again be struck.\n\nAmerica’s change in position is driven purely out of necessity for its own self-interest; however, with no end in sight in Ukraine, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US is adopting softer attitudes toward its oil-rich adversaries, in particular Iran. For Pakistan, this is a now or never opportunity: capitalise on the west’s relaxation now and secure deals with Iran or delay the opportunity and ultimately face the wrath of the west.\n\nAnother hurdle Pakistan faces when it comes to Iran is the Saudi Arabian question. Any venture with Iran risks the upsetting of ‘brotherly’ Saudi Arabia, and although Pakistan has remained explicitly neutral in the pair’s cold war – through the training, support, and cooperation with its armed forces – it is clear that Islamabad indirectly sides with Riyadh. As a result, Pakistan’s alliance with the Saudis bars it from exploring real terms with Iran.\n\nIn the past year, however, there have been growing signs of rapprochement between the two arch rivals. Through the meditation of Iraq and Oman, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been willing to sit at the peace table and are now engaging in their fifth round of direct talks. Furthermore, with the cessation of hostilities in Yemen as well as the re-opening of the Iranian representative office in the OIC, analysts are hopeful that the two countries are finally coming to some form of an agreement, and the possibility of re-establishing diplomatic missions is not too far fetched.\n\nAs for Pakistani gains in light of such developments, they are significant. Not only can Islamabad now engage peacefully with Tehran, without alienating Saudi Arabia, but it can also facilitate further reconciliation between the two countries and emerge as a key mediator of peace in the region.\n\nWith the roadblocks to cooperation finally lifting, Pakistan and Iran can pave the way for a great alliance. This alliance can take two forms, one of an economic dimension and the other of a non-economic one. However, the beauty of a Pak-Iran alliance is not in its business prospective nor the cultural linkages but in the fact that it is mutually beneficial. At home, both Iran and Pakistan face pressing issues of different kinds, yet both sides can help each other solve their respective problems.\n\nThe major cornerstone of Pak-Iran relations has been the proposed Pakistan-Iran (IP) gas pipeline, a proposition which can mutually benefit both sides simultaneously. Stretching from South Pars all the way to Punjab, the 1900km pipeline would provide inestimable value for both Pakistan and Iran. As it currently stands, however, the IP gas pipeline is an opportunity fading away. Despite the project’s inception nearly a decade ago, the pipeline has yet to even start. Iran’s side of the pipeline is built but has simply been left to rust, while Pakistan’s side is waiting to start construction.\n\nThe causes of Pakistan’s lack of initiative is due to the abovementioned external pressure coupled with internal distrust, leading to the project’s early abandonment. However, this can all change. As stated before, Iran’s rapidly changing geopolitical image, as well as the easing of Pakistani challenges vis-a-vis foreign policy could usher in a new wave of enthusiasm. The IP gas pipeline could finally restart and ultimately benefit the two countries immensely.\n\nPlagued with severe energy shortages, depleting indigenous sources and inchoate industries, Pakistan is on the brink of energy starvation. So far, loans and expensive imports have kept the energy sector afloat, but these are short-term solutions and are unsustainable in the long run. As for local energy sources within the country, they too have proven insufficient.\n\nUltimately, Pakistan will need to increase its imported energy, preferably at cheap and subsidised rates. Once revived, however, the IP gas pipeline can solve the majority of these problems. Providing 22 million cubic metres of gas a day, and electricity generation equivalent to nearly 4,500 megawatts, the pipeline would be able to meet nearly all of Pakistan’s current electricity shortfall. Furthermore, compared to its current import from countries such as Qatar, Iranian LNG is far more affordable.\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, the IP gas pipeline can cement Pak-Iran relations and effectively thwart expanding Indian influence in the region. What’s more interesting is that in 2016, China expressed the desire to invest in the pipeline and expand it into its own borders. Iran welcomed Chinese interest and sweetened the deal by expressing interest in joining the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). If Iran joins, an unparalleled trifecta in the region could emerge, hence promoting development, peace and stability. Although it is too early to tell right now, initial willingness from different countries has shown that the IP gas pipeline could be a catalyst for extraordinary cooperation in the region and beyond.\n\nFor Iran, the IP gas pipeline could provide much-needed relief to its ailing economy. Crippled by years of brutal sanctions, Iran has failed to effectively monetise its abundant oil and gas supplies, and as a result, has suffered from abysmally low GDP figures. Notably absent from LNG and oil markets, Iran is missing out and is eager to establish itself as a force in the economic world. Moreover, Iran has lacked an iron brother-like alliance with any of its neighbours to assist in alleviating its crises. For example, Iraq is embroiled in constant turmoil and lacks stability for any strong alliance to emerge, while neighbours in the Caucasus do not see eye-to-eye with Iran. However, an economic alliance with Pakistan is not only stable and safe, but the market of 220 million people can provide ample opportunity for Iran to fulfil its economic needs.\n\nOver the past decades, an environment of trepidation and apprehension has developed in place of a potentially fraternal relationship between Pakistan and Iran. The two countries have continually looked away from one another, opting to search thousands of miles away for rather unsustainable and short-lived alliances. However, as Pakistan and Iran unshackle themselves from the constraints of geopolitics, they must look towards one another for a better future.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/image1654671439-0/image1654671439-0.png"}, {"headline": "Does gun control even matter to GOP members and the NRA?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97595/does-gun-control-even-matter-to-gop-members-and-the-nra", "date_published": "Tue, 07 Jun 22 11:29:25 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMass shootings are gaining renewed momentum across the United States (US) in light of the Texas school shooting and Memorial Day gun violence in Chicago. The former incident is said to be the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook. These are just a few instances of gun violence that get plastered all over the news, and rightfully so.\n\nAccording to Gun Violence Archive, there have been at least 246 mass shootings in the US so far this year, far more than the number of days passed in 2022. More than 2,000 American teenagers between the ages 12 to 17 have been shot dead or injured this year. There have been 8,346 gun-related deaths, 15,768 injuries and 634 unintentional shootings. Moreover, 473 children between ages zero to 11 years were shot during the first half of this year. What also appears to be gripping parts of the US are imitation mass murders. Following the Memorial Day shootings, there have been 13 others this past weekend, leaving more than a dozen dead and at least 70 injured. Gun violence is an act of terrorism that is encouraging repressed individuals to come forward and commit crimes openly.\n\nIt is critical to consider the complexity of America’s gun violence epidemic. Although mass shooters target innocent civilians at large, people kill in self-defense; they also commit suicide using weapons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2020, 54% of all gun-related deaths in the US were suicides (24,292). Therefore, gun violence should never be equated to mass shootings alone. The issue is more nuanced than we think.\n\nTake for instance the Covid-19 pandemic. It caused 45,000 deaths (suicide or homicide) by guns. These deaths can be partly attributed to loss of jobs, psychological strain and exacerbated mental illness that Americans experienced in 2020.\n\nThat said, gun violence in America continues to take an emotional toll on families, while gun advocates observe in silence. Gun advocacy is a big part of the problem to push for safer, smarter gun control measures. A vocal proponent of guns is Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who signed seven laws, making it easier for people to access guns, including individuals over 21 who can carry a handgun without license and training. Easier access to guns caused gun violence to soar in Texas, which has one of the highest numbers of mass shootings in the US. Last year, Texas saw a 65% increase in mass shootings.\n\nOn top of gun advocates and GOP (republican party) members backing their second amendment rights, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has an equally important role to play in politicising gun control. It is no surprise that the NRA uses funds to push its agenda forward, which is to support guns left-right-centre. They use heaps of money to sway the debate surrounding gun control in their favour. Numerous Republicans⁠, Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, Mitch McConnell, and a dozen others have benefited from the NRA in the past, including a law firm that has backed the association for years in exchange of $23 million.\n\nIn the wake of deadly mass shootings, it is unfathomable that the NRA would hold its annual meeting days after the Robb Elementary School massacre. This insensitive move demonstrates the NRA’s audacity to push for gun rights in a time when thousands of families grieve the loss of their loved ones. The association claims that it is “committed to making schools secure” but it is only in the guise of hypocrisy.\n\nAlthough democrat states including New York and California are making concerted efforts to counter gun violence through bills and gun buyback programs, these efforts will never budge GOP members. Schools, colleges, theaters and bars will continue to be targets of mass shootings because second amendment rights hold more value than human life in Republican states.\n\nSo, where is the middle ground if there is no solution to gun control at all? The key is to keep gun laws intact but changing the eligibility criteria of who qualifies to own a gun. A person with a history of mental illness should never have access to guns. This begs the question: how do you know someone is mentally unfit to own a gun? That is where running thorough background checks comes into play. These background checks can help curb a potential mass shooter from committing mass murder.\n\nIn addition, the legal age to own a gun should be raised from 18 years to at least 21. Right now, individuals 18 and older can be sold long guns, which is alarming given that two 18 year-olds were responsible for the deadliest school shootings in America (Sandy Hook and the recent Robb Elementary School shootings). Countries such as Norway, Canada, New Zealand and Australia managed to curb gun violence through smart gun laws. The rate of mass shootings has sharply declined in these countries. Perhaps the US should extract valuable lessons and parallel similar gun reform strategies, if not exactly the same.\n\nThe media plays a very essential role to get the word about gun control out to the public. If media agencies including digital, print and broadcast, set aside their political differences and harmonise to address gun violence and gun control, things can steer in the right direction. Media coverage of mass shootings across the country can raise more alarm about gun violence in America, which can lead to protests, political pressure and ultimately, some form of resolution.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/OHKOJWUK2FLT7FEKYXS47ABT3I1653551321-0/OHKOJWUK2FLT7FEKYXS47ABT3I1653551321-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Why developing countries should not reduce their reliance on fossil fuels", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97593/why-developing-countries-should-not-reduce-their-reliance-on-fossil-fuels", "date_published": "Fri, 03 Jun 22 09:57:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn just 24 days in 2022, an average American had produced more carbon than an average Pakistani would produce in the whole year. In just three days, an average Australian emits more carbon dioxide than his counterpart would do in the whole year in Niger. The video gaming industry in the United States (US) consumes more electricity than any country in Africa. Of the total 1.5 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere since the middle of the 18th century, 70 per cent has been produced by the US, China, Europe and Russia, with the US being the largest emitter by far. \n\nThese are some of the facts that reflect a wide gap between posturing by the rich countries of the world of being considerate of the environment and the deplorable ground reality.\n\nThe richest countries are home to half of the world’s population and emit 86 per cent of the world’s total carbon dioxide emissions. If we are to improve the climate and limit global heating to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, carbon emissions have to be curbed and more action is required from the rich and developed countries. Many in the developing world are of the opinion that the global north has already benefited from fossil fuels and now that it has all the means and resources to shift to cleaner energy, it is imposing the same on the global south where people are yet to attain a higher standard of living. Critical energy projects for less economically developed countries are being banned under the garb of environmental conservation.\n\nAt the 26th Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) held in 2021, more than 20 countries – including the US and some European nations – pledged to stop foreign fossil fuel financing while giving no indication of curbing their domestic production and expansion. Such two-faced actions do more harm than good: one, by pushing poor countries further to the brink; and two, by making a mockery of environmentalism and snatching away its true spirit and purpose.\n\nIn a similar move, China announced last year that it won’t build new coal-fired power plants abroad. China has been the major contributor to Pakistan’s coal-powered energy sector in the recent past. Pakistan has total coal reserves of more than 185 billion tonnes and ranks seventh among the countries with the largest lignite coal reserves. These reserves can ensure sustainable development by keeping the economic and social pillars of sustainability intact through empowerment, improved well-being and availability of opportunities for the present and future generations.\n\nDepriving the developing world of growth and development by curbing the supply of fossil fuels or by halting investments in fossil-generated energy projects will deteriorate beleaguered economies. It is important that the global south be allowed to follow the same path to development as the global north took, that is, by ensuring development through industrialisation, even if it came through the use of fossil fuels. Economic prosperity will, in fact, enable the availability of necessary resources and capital to protect another pillar of sustainability – the environment. This doesn’t mean that development will necessarily come at the expense of the environment. Environmentally-friendly fuel to energy conversion technologies can be used to mitigate harmful environmental impacts. Instead of curbing the funding of fossil-generated energy projects, the richer countries should invest in the use of less harmful methods of energy generation through fossil fuels.\n\nReadily available and economically viable energy options are the need of the hour for many developing countries like Pakistan, without which the achievement of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will remain a distant dream.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1080201-SmokestackinChinaCarbonemissionsAFPxx-1459978271/1080201-SmokestackinChinaCarbonemissionsAFPxx-1459978271.jpg"}, {"headline": "It’s not about being pro-abortion, it’s about being pro-choice", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97578/its-not-about-being-pro-abortion-its-about-being-pro-choice", "date_published": "Sat, 07 May 22 10:24:08 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSome interesting developments (or lack thereof) have surfaced about the abortion laws in the United States (US). Feminists who fought long and hard for a woman’s right to choose are turning in their graves after discovering that Justice Samuel Alito is considering overturning a landmark decision in the case of Roe v Wade, which sought to protect abortion rights in the US almost 50 years ago. An initial draft of the said move has been leaked. Even though this leaked draft is not the final verdict or opinion of the court, it has however sparked a serious wave of reactions and disappointment from abortion rights advocates. If the final call reflects the opinion draft, America will see a drastic shift regarding abortion rights in the country.\n\nFor anyone not already familiar with the original Roe v Wade, here is a quick description and a somewhat lengthy explanation about its significance for women’s rights. A landmark decision was taken in 1973 by the US Supreme Court that ruled that the Constitution of the US protected women’s liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restrictions. This decision ultimately opened up safe spaces and clinics for women who wished to have abortions done, with services provided by fully trained and licensed physicians. The decision ultimately explained that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution provides “a right to privacy” which protects a pregnant woman’s rights to choose. Furthermore, the court reasoned those outlawing abortions would violate a pregnant woman’s right to privacy for reasons such as:\n\n\n\thaving unwanted children would lead to a distressful life and future for the woman;\n\tit may cause long-term psychological harm which could result in poor care of the child considering the mother’s weak physical and mental health;\n\tand because there may be “distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child”.\n\n\nThe decision was celebrated by abortion rights advocates as this was a huge move towards recognising women’s rights when it came to making their own choices about their bodies. And why shouldn’t it be? The benefits of legalised abortion are plentiful – fewer illegitimate births, smaller welfare costs, less children born as a result of rape. However, according to Alito, the constitution makes no such reference to abortion and that no such right is implicitly protected by the constitutional provision.\n\nTherefore, the overturning of Roe v Wade would lead to stricter limits on abortion access largely in the South and Midwest, with about half of the states set to immediately enforce broad abortion bans. On the other hand, the following 16 states have laws in place to protect the right to abortion: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\n\nWhy this debate is causing such an uproar is not only because this is overall a huge setback for women’s right to choose what they want to do with their bodies but also the deep negative impact the ban will have (if implemented) on women who are prevented from obtaining abortions. Some of these adverse consequences include mental, physical and financial impacts. It has been proven in several studies that being denied an abortion is linked with an increase in anxiety, stress and lower self-esteem shortly after the denial. Women who are denied abortions also experience financial hardship, including an increase in household poverty considering there are additional mouths to feed and there are no strict laws around having the biological father provide child care support.\n\nIf abortion is to be banned and women’s bodies are to be controlled by a bunch of old white men, then perhaps they should also consider the consequences this will have on those very women, especially rape victims who have to carry the child of their abuser for nine months and then live with that trauma forever; while also being at risk of being contacted by the rapist for child custody or continued sexual violence and harassment. The ban would also greatly impact teenage mothers, sex workers and/or those women who become pregnant in cases of premarital and extramarital affairs. The fear of raising the child alone and being financially incapable of raising the child are of the top most reasons of pregnancy termination. Another very common reason for terminating a pregnancy is known as “young age pregnancy”, which ultimately would affect the young girl’s life negatively, while restricting her mobility and opportunities. Why is it that controlling women’s bodies and hindering their bodily autonomy is always up for debate, yet men’s accountability is hardly ever spoken about?\n\nA better draft opinion to read about would’ve been the US Supreme Court leaning towards providing free vasectomies for men. It’s a fairly painless and reversible process which does not cause any kind of long-term psychological or physical ailments. If men who get women pregnant can ‘choose’ not be part of the raising process, they should be encouraged to undergo the medical procedure so as to not cause pregnancies at all. The procedure can be reversed if and when they decide to have children consensually with their partner. But of course, restricting men’s bodily autonomy would be of the utmost disgrace and disrespect.\n\nAccording to Alito’s draft opinion, the idea that the abortion bans reflect the subjugation of women in American society is wrong considering women still have electoral and political power. By this logic, if women possess the right to vote or hold a public position, they should completely give up the right to decide what they want to do with their bodies because a few people who don’t even have a uterus can feel important about themselves. I wonder if these people who have decided to put these rights up for debates in the first place have even researched about the topic at all. It is actually quite obvious that despite the bans on abortions, they will continue to take place, only they will be unsafe and painful ones. Post-abortion care is essential for addressing disabilities caused by induced or self-induced abortions because they can surely be taken care of. However, the likelihood of women having access to post-abortion care and services will be practically zero in the states where the ban is to be implemented.\n\nThe US claims to be a superpower leading the world with its impeccable score on all fronts as a nation, but ironically their conservative ideas around minority rights have always remained questionable. These abortion laws are no different. Abortion is a reality, which is why it is essential that women be provided with affordable and easily accessible services without any pre-conceived notions and biases. The right to choose is a fundamental one and courts should challenge their abortion laws instead of executing bans that are only an attack on women’s freedom. If there is a ban which needs to be implemented immediately it is America’s gun laws which take more lives than abortions, with conviction rates of criminals at a disappointingly low rate, especially if the shooter is described as a white male. Pro-life advocates who are for the ban need to rethink their priorities and direct their energy into making more sensible arguments and fight for the justice of innocent children and adults who have been killed during school hours or in movie theatres by white American men who have the freedom to legally obtain a weapon over the counter, that too without a license or any understandable reason.\n\nThis is not about being pro-abortion, this is about being pro-choice, that no matter what your personal feelings or beliefs about abortion are, you understand it is not your place to make a decision for another woman about what she can and cannot do with her body.\n\nTo know where Pakistan stands on abortion laws, you can read my detailed piece here.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651920521-0/Cover1651920521-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Follow Riasat-e-Medina in Pakistan but not in Medina itself", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97576/follow-riasat-e-medina-in-pakistan-but-not-in-medina-itself", "date_published": "Sat, 30 Apr 22 10:01:34 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tYou know things have truly gone down the drain when local politics in Pakistan is unnecessarily taken out of context, literally, and used as a sorry excuse to spread hatred, ignorance, violence and blatant sexism. In the most recent case of embarrassing and shameful events, supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) went ahead and created complete havoc at Masjid-e-Nabawi without thinking twice about the historical and religious importance of the very ground they stood on.\n\nIn case they forgot, here is a quick reminder: Masjid-e-Nabawi is one of the most sacred places in Medina for Muslims. Considering Pakistanis have self-appointed themselves as the sole protectors of Islam for so long by protecting and defending blasphemy laws in the hope of punishing (even if wrongly) those who apparently disrespect Islam, this very act in Medina has proved that nothing – not even a place of worship during one of the holiest months for Muslims – can stop these devils from showing their true colours.\n\nThere is a nasty video being circulated on social media showing a bunch of men chanting slogans of “chor, chor” (thieves) at some members of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s delegation in Medina. Not only that, it is clearly visible and audible the highly disrespectful and profane language and slogans being hurled at the current Federal Minister of Information and Broadcasting Maryam Aurangzeb. Using disrespectful and disconcerting sexist slogans against women is so outdated but, since a patriarchal induced understanding of gender and culture plagues this country so deeply, this is hardly a surprise. Degrading and violating women has long been used as a tool and indicator of victory in wars, and this, it seems, is no different – especially since Imran Khan keeps comparing this whole political escapade to the battle of Karbala.\n\nThe harassment faced by various members of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) while performing their religious duties has raised eyebrows across the globe as Pakistanis are yet again being highlighted for their deranged actions. The sanctity of the holy mosque has been spoiled and there is no justification for carrying out dirty political agendas on holy sites.\n\nAs if the political garbage that we’re witnessing first-hand in Pakistan wasn’t enough, we are now a mere laughing spectacle for those nations whom we have tried to convince otherwise in the hopes of building amicable relations. As if our perceived association with terrorism wasn’t enough, this has added another feather to our embarrassment cap. If Imran set out to create a Riasat-e-Medina in Pakistan, perhaps he should give sermons to his followers on how to effectively follow the rules of Medina in Medina at the very least. It’s obvious that pre-planning this stunt did not go the way he wished. Sadly, and evidently, this cult mentality has brought politically blinded citizens to a point where they see nothing wrong with what they did. Many have not even bothered to condemn this awful incident, and the rest are still finding ways to justify it.\n\nYes, every citizen of a country should be well-aware and critical of the politics of their country and should be able to question their leaders whenever they see irregularities, injustices and/or discrimination taking place. But to be politically charged to this extent is very dangerous since some Pakistanis will export their violent and extremist attitudes to the countries which have allowed them in, further causing global isolation. These actions are mostly perpetuated by men, and usually women have to pay the price. But alas, when a so-called leader openly supports sexual harassers and believes in victim-shaming, one can hardly expect any wise, well-thought out and grounded decision-making.\n\nI am amazed at how effortlessly all of this has been planned and implemented. This particular incident reeks of misogyny and hypocrisy at all levels. It is obvious that this will destabilise and polarise the nation further, and will make violence an acceptable form of ‘protest’. The common saying “politics can be dirty” is an understatement in the case of Pakistan. Our politics is not only ours, it’s for the entire world to find entertainment in. But, more importantly, it is a disgrace to the religion we hold so dear.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651313943-0/Cover1651313943-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Are we on the brink of a global recession?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97575/are-we-on-the-brink-of-a-global-recession", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Apr 22 08:21:09 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSince Covid-19 brought the world to a halt in 2020, life has been nothing short of a nightmare. We have already seen unprecedented national lockdowns, social distancing measures, overburdened hospitals, and mass casualties all over the world. However, with the introduction of vaccinations, we assumed the horror was finally over, but nothing could be farther from the truth. With inflation on the rise, widespread supply chain bottlenecks, and rising geopolitical tensions, governments face a monumental task in steering their countries away from a crisis. Looking at the current global situation, it is clear that we are in deep waters and may be on the verge of a global recession.\n\nWith economies all over the world reopening and consumers returning to markets, the main issue that central banks are dealing with is rising consumer prices. To combat inflation from rising any further, central banks started winding down their quantitative easing measures put in place at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, these measures were rendered ineffective due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which exacerbated global supply chains and drove commodity prices to historic highs, adding fuel to the already raging fire.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict has been detrimental to oil and gas prices, which have risen sharply. Furthermore, the two countries are large exporters of agricultural commodities, and account for nearly 14% of global wheat trade. Similarly, Russia and Ukraine account for nearly 19% of global barley exports and nearly 52% of global sunflower oil exports.\n\nIt is also important to note that, because Russia is a major fertiliser exporter, sanctions against the country could have a negative impact on fertiliser supply around the world, lowering crop yields. Russia is also a major supplier of valuable minerals such as palladium, titanium, nickel, and neon. Palladium, in particular, is a critical component in automobile manufacturing, and its price has increased astronomically since the war began. Supply disruptions in these commodities from Russia and Ukraine have driven up consumer prices even further.\n\nAside from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, China’s zero-Covid policy is causing mayhem in commodity supplies all over the world. The imposition of strict lockdowns and travel restrictions is harming demand and economic growth in the world's second-largest economy. Shanghai, the world’s busiest container port, is closed due to an uptick in coronavirus infections in the region. As a result, hundreds of cargo ships have been stranded in the port.\n\nMoving forward, China's return to a Covid-zero state is highly unlikely given the likelihood of new coronavirus variants emerging in the future. As a result, the global economy is predicted to stay under pressure, at least in the short term, and inflation is expected to continue its upward trend, forcing central banks to continue hiking interest rates until the global macroeconomic outlook stabilises.\n\nConsequently, given the Russia-Ukraine war and the slowing down of China’s economy, policymakers around the world are considering the likelihood of the global economy entering into a recession. According to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the growth of the global economy will drop to 2.8% in 2022. Earlier, it had predicted that the global economy would expand by nearly 4.1% before Russia declared war on Ukraine. Similarly, as per WoodMac, a research and consultancy company, the global economy is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2022 and 0.7% in 2023.\n\nInvestors around the world are already tweaking their strategies and becoming more cautious as uncertainty in global markets continues to rise. This is clear from the inversion of the American Treasury yield curve, which indicates that investors are shifting away from risky equities and towards short-term fixed income bonds in an attempt to protect themselves from the possibility of the global economy slowing down in the short term. Furthermore, fund managers around the world are also increasing the weightage of cash in their portfolios.\n\nConsidering the aforementioned warning signs such as rising inflation, inversion of the American treasury yield curve, and portfolio reallocation by global fund managers, the likelihood of the global economy entering a recession in the short term is high. Hence, countries are at a critical juncture where policymakers must be proactive in dealing with the looming issues, and governments should be actively seeking for ways to protect their respective countries from the implications of a global recession.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1651134728-0/Cover1651134728-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "From India to Bharat", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97566/from-india-to-bharat", "date_published": "Wed, 06 Apr 22 10:18:47 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIf centuries of plunder in the subcontinent, communal rifts and destructive power struggles were someone’s fault, whose were they? Were they ours? Was it theirs? I’m still searching for the answers but what I do know is that our past divided us then and it continues to divide us now. The fact that Narendra Modi’s India is a polarised state practicing blatant discrimination of minority communal groups and economic classes isn’t news. Modi’s rise to power isn’t an anomaly; it isn’t just a chapter in India’s history – it's a carefully crafted manifestation of an ideology. \n\nHave you ever wondered how and why Jawaharlal Nehru’s “azaad” India has embarked on such a journey? How and why is the very nature of the world’s largest democracy being rebuilt? Is it really that bad?\n\nHindutva: who is a Hindu?\n\nWith the arrival of European missionaries in India, the practice of proselytism not only threatened the socio-religious structure of society, it also brought changes in its demography. To resist the new faith, Hindu reformers endowed their religion with egalitarian values through a reinterpretation of the – highly abstract in nature – Vedas. This led to the creation of a golden age of Hinduism which was then supported by movements such as the Arya Samaj. The 1919 mobilisation of Indian Muslims in support of the Caliphate of Constantinople – the Khilafat movement – solidified the “majoritarian inferiority complex” of the Hindus due to its Pan-Islamic nature.\n\nIt was in this context that VD Savarkar codified the Hindu nationalist ideology, citing four factors in determining the eligibility of a “Hindu” – race (Aryan decent and Vedic fathers), territory (Vedic land where the holy rivers flow), language (Sanskrit) and culture. Savarkar also pointed out the similarities between his definition of “who is a Hindu” and the Zionists. MS Golwalkar’s views on the topic went one step ahead. He believed that Muslims of India did not deserve “even citizen rights” in the Hindu state. Their only option was to either submit or leave. These were the narratives which led to the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1925.\n\nTowards BJP\n\nThe organisation which started off by combating communists grew into a tentacular Sangh Parivar over the years with numerous sector-based organisations that gradually saturated the social space. The aim of the Sangh Parivar is state formation, not mere state-building. RSS entered the political arena in the 1950s after Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination by an alleged member of the movement and a close aid of Savarkar. Undoubtedly a dark time in the RSS’s history, the national outrage led to the arrests of 20,000 Swayamsevaks and the outlawing of the organisation which Nehru saw as an “Indian embodiment of fascism”. The Bharatiya Janata Sangh (BJS) was created by Golwalkar in 1951 in response to these developments.\n\nIn the time leading up to Modi’s rule in Gujrat, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, formerly BJS) had garnered considerable support in India, capitalising on its role in the Ayodhya Movement which resulted in violent clashes between the Hindu and Muslim communities during the “Ram Yatra”. Since then, the BJP has emerged as a populist party in India’s ethnic democracy which is against any and all things it deems a threat to the RSS ideology. The BJP’s primary targets are Muslims and Indian secularism. Its more concealed motives include the continued socioeconomic repression of the other backward classes (OBCs) and the scheduled castes (SCs), together with a complete dismantling of the very ethos of India’s once renowned impartial institutions.\n\nA lesson in populism \n\nIf there was ever a book titled “populism for dummies”, an account of Modi’s rise to power is sure to make an appearance. A product of the RSS, Modi in a true populist fashion rose to power following the Gujrat riots. During this time, violence was promoted and validated against Muslims, the “other”, by Modi and RSS radicals in response to the Godhra tragedy. Communal differences were then exacerbated to a point of no return, and it is from here that Modi’s populism turned into national populism. His humble beginnings helped him connect with the masses on an unprecedented scale and his shrewdness coupled with charisma propelled him into the status of an “ideal”. He was at once borne out of a mythology yet remained rooted in reality.\n\nDistancing himself from the Muslims, Modi established himself as an “Emperor of The Hindu Hearts”. His economic policies accelerated the growth rate in Gujrat – albeit at the expense of the proletariat – which would later lead him to tout the “Gujrat Model” in his 2014 election campaign. Subsequently, in the 2000s, when Islamic terrorism was at its peak, Modi would find himself at the centre of assassination attempts supposedly sponsored by ‘jihadis’. It did not matter that there was a complete lack of evidence to support the claims that the Pakistani state was behind this supposed threat, or that the ‘jihadis’ arrested were later acquitted by the Indian courts. He had established his national populist repertoire – a feat which would get him elected as the prime minister for two consecutive terms.\n\nThe first term \n\nDuring his first term, Modi focused on raising the “self-esteem” and “dignity” of the Indian people by introducing programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jan-Dhan Yojana, and Ujjwala Yojana. While there were no concrete reforms to help raise the economic status of his newly created “neo-middle class” or the poor, he also scaled back on the previously launched pro-poor programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Modi’s urban consumer bias was apparent in the economic policies put forth which facilitated crony capitalism. He diverted the people’s attention by focusing on social justice and keeping communal violence brewing to appease his “angry young men” who had taken the law into their own hands primarily through vigilantism (The Bajrang Dal).\n\nThis constant cycle of fear of the “Other” converting into anger was apparent in the activities of the Gau Rakshak Dal. Moreover, campaigns against ‘love jihad’ and ‘land jihad’ further unveiled the anti-Muslim sentiments of not only the state but Indian society as well. In the larger scheme of things, Modi’s politics led to the banalisation of Hindutva, reformation of the education system in line with the RSS ideology, crackdown on secularists and free press, ‘reconversion’ campaigns, opening up the state apparatus to the RSS, and deterioration of India’s once revered institutions including the police, Supreme Court, media, and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\n\nModi 2.0\n\nBy the 2019 elections, India had already converted into a “De-Facto Hindu Rashtra”. Staying true to his saintly politics, Modi centered his campaign on an “external enemy” – Pakistan. The Balakot strikes following the Pulwama attack, together with Pakistan’s goodwill gesture of Wing Commander Abhinandan’s release were hailed as ‘victories’ in India. Interestingly, Bharat, by then, had embarked on a path towards electoral authoritarianism, thus the main opposition parties barely stood a chance.\n\nCapitalising off caste politics and plebian support for the “strong man”, the BJP, with the conquest of the Rajya Sabha, was now in a position to fulfill its primary objectives – the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the abrogation of Article 370. The Ayodhya verdict was the final nail in India’s secular identity. Christophe Jaffrelot thereby concludes that India is now an ethnic democracy wherein the Hindus are bound by racial, linguistic, religious or other such cultural characteristics. Their strong sense of identity is pivotal for the rejection of the “other” which isn’t protected by the government nor the international community.\n\nThe greatest divide \n\nIn a democratic structure, regardless of the adjectives, claiming to be ‘apolitical’ is perhaps the highest tier of ignorance. If democracy is a government by the people, for the people, and from the people, how can the two ever be separated? Of course, outliers do exist, but when a feat is present in majority, it becomes the norm. BJP’s anti-Muslim bias, RSS’s Hindutva ideology, and Modi’s populist politics exist and thrive in India, for the Indian people, by the Indian citizens, from the Indian society. India’s polarisation was triggered by deep-seated insecurities, and with multiple fears and numerous threats – real or fake – assimilation becomes the best course of action. While there is beauty in diversity, there is security in homogenisation. It looks like the people of India have chosen their rulers. Where this majoritarian rule leads Bharat will unravel a new chapter in the history of war itself – the Greatest Divide is yet to come.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1649243028-0/Cover1649243028-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "What should be on the OIC’s agenda?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97560/what-should-be-on-the-oics-agenda", "date_published": "Tue, 22 Mar 22 11:13:05 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) signed a charter in 1969 aiming for peace, solidarity and mutual economic development. One premium objective of the charter is the commitment of the states to following ‘International Law.’ The charter also profoundly adopts the fundamental freedoms, human rights and good governance for development as the core of the international policy system and organisational structure. Although criticised, another landmark development under the OIC system was the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, which complements the Declaration on Human Rights and other United Nations (UN) human rights instruments.\n\nFurthermore, the Astana Declaration as policy guidance for investment in science, technology, education and development is significant for the effective implementation of sustainable development goals or the development agenda of 2030. As the OIC is the second largest intergovernmental organisation after the UN, it was expected that it would be safeguarding Muslim rights and interests in the global policy system.\n\nHowever, the charter governing the 1.8 billion in the contemporary era of globalisation is still seeking an effective implementation plan because most of the developing and underdeveloped Muslim states are equipped with poor governance and mismanaged structures. The objectivity of the OIC in the developmental agenda counters the hegemony and individualistic approaches. As members of the OIC are currently meeting in Islamabad, it is worth considering what the OIC should aim to achieve over the coming years.\n\nThe member states of the OIC implemented non-interference in their internal matters and pursued secular interests over the developmental agenda. The war among a few Muslim States is one example. Foreign intervention is another. This simultaneously indicated in the past that Muslim states’ inter-relations in sub-systems cannot be translated into one big policy umbrella. The given issues also highlight the apparent reasons for not having any meaningful Muslim representation in the global policy system.\n\nThe pertinent question now is how the OIC, as the key representing the authority of Muslim states, can be effective in the global policy system. OIC theoretically attempted to portray itself as an organisation that upholds the ‘global Islamic agenda’, and that it is somehow similar to the UN instruments reflecting human rights, peace and sustainable development. To implement the human rights agenda effectively, the OIC must think about an organisational structure that may monitor and report to the authorities. There could be a multilateral court of justice following the regional judicial systems of Europe, Africa and South America.\n\nMore legitimisation of the OIC through establishing a meaningful ‘executive’ under the sub-state system shall present a robust approach towards implementing the local agenda of 2030. The OIC may also think about more sub-committees or sub-groups on diverse but common development policy programmes.\n\nAlthough it seems that the OIC has a limited role in the effective implementation of the agenda of Muslim states, the OIC may rethink how the local implementation of global agendas can help its voice in the global policy system. The OIC can bring together the states and people for common issues such as climate change, poverty eradication, human development and environmentalism.\n\nWhat is more prominent is that the initial establishment of the OIC emphasised the ‘Ummah,’ which may encompass the Muslim representation worldwide and welcome integration of other states with the Muslim population. More importantly, the affiliation in the OIC system as a non-observer state can be closely linked to present challenges of corruption, poor governance, unsustainable development, climate change and environmental crises.\n\nIt is undeniable that financial assistance is the only way forward for such agendas, and for such purposes, more extensive integration in the OIC of developed states cannot be avoided. So far, the challenges of inequitable growth and development are not addressed by the international policy systems and are unlikely to be resolved. The UN 2030 agenda has already suggested regional and sub-regional integration for common goals towards more considerable cooperation.\n\nIf the OIC is seeking an influential role in the sustainable development agenda of 2030, it should reframe its existing governance mechanism. The recognition of the future development agenda as suggested by the UN shall be recognised by the OIC and shall address the 17 primary goals for human development in the Muslim states. In doing so, the OIC must reconsider the assistance of policy experts, academia, social scientists, stakeholders and specific-area experts. Such initiatives will provide the OIC with valuable global representation.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1647948826-0/Cover1647948826-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "India’s institutionalised prejudice against Islamophobia", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/article/97557/indias-institutionalised-prejudice-against-islamophobia", "date_published": "Fri, 18 Mar 22 10:35:30 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIndia recently called out the United Nations (UN) resolution which declares May 15th as the International Day to combat Islamophobia. TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, expressed concern that an emphasis on one religion takes away attention from the phobias against Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism. He states that India had offered sanctuary to Zoroastrians, Jews and others in the spirit of pluralism and expressed concern regarding the attack on gurudwaras (Sikh temples), the destruction of Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, and the glorification of the breaking of idols. Tirumurti further said he instead preferred the generic term religion-phobia to combat hatred against all religions.\n\nSuch a position was to be expected from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) India, which is bent on ‘decolonising’ the influence of past Muslim invaders by furthering the dharmic faiths (Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism) at the expense of demonising present-day Muslims and Islam. The fact that the ruling party remains strategically quiet when calls for genocide of Muslims are made is a testament to this observation. Scores of Hindutva trolls are usually out and about on Pakistani and other social media sites where they demonise Muslims and perpetuate their victimhood despite being an overwhelming majority in India. It is against this backdrop that the Indian representative brazenly projected his country’s institutionalised prejudice.\n\nHowever, Tirumurti conveniently failed to recognise and mention the systemic genocide of the Rohingya Muslims by Buddhists in Myanmar, the concentration camps of Uighurs in China, the mass destruction of Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq in a post 9/11 world that has led to the universal singling out of Muslims and Islam. He ignored the fact that two billion Muslims are often generalised and stereotyped as terrorists and that many Sikhs in the West are targeted not because of their Sikhism but because they are perceived as Muslims. In other words, the targeting of people of colour and Sikhs in the West is also because of Islamophobia.\n\nIt is true that Hindu girls face forced conversion in the Sindh province of Pakistan, but this oppression is unique to that province (based on feudalism) and is not found in Arab countries. Similarly, the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was perpetrated by the rogue Taliban and not other Afghans who have enjoyed good relations with India. In fact, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has recently facilitated the construction of a large Hindu temple as well. The same goes for Pakistan that unilaterally took steps to facilitate Sikh pilgrims to their holy sites in Pakistan. If anything, it was the Indian government that took draconian steps against Sikhs and the Golden Temple in the mid-80s.\n\nThe Indian representative mentioned the glorification of the breaking of idols, which is reminiscent of the past Muslim invaders from central Asia in the age of empires. However, those Muslim invaders from Persia, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and other central Asian places are long dead. It was a different time where human rights violations were perpetrated by anyone and everyone. The sacking of Baghdad by the Mongols is one such example. However, the BJP and its leader Narendra Modi seem fixated on the past and not on the present where their government has singled out and marginalised Muslims through the Citizenship Act.\n\nThe whatbaoutism of the Indian state in an attempt to deflect attention away from Islamophobia towards “religion-phobia” is clear for everyone to see. The words of Tirumurti remind us of those white supremacists who argue against “Black Lives Matter” by responding with “All Lives Matter”, or of those homophobes who argue against the Pride Parade by resorting to the inanities of “what about Straight Parade”.\n\nIt is time India stops comparing itself to Pakistan, which itself has huge issues of intolerance, and starts addressing its internal issues of the systemic discrimination and Hindutva calls for genocide of their own Muslim minorities.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Cover1647603749-0/Cover1647603749-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistani migrants bounce back", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2370889/pakistani-migrants-bounce-back", "date_published": "Fri, 12 Aug 22 20:47:25 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe number of Pakistani nationals migrating for work mostly to the Gulf countries has bounced back to the pre-Covid-19 level to around 65,000 per month in January 2022 in the wake of rising income of oil exporting Arab countries and advanced economies around the world.\n\n“The monthly flow of Pakistani workers (abroad) has reverted to pre-Covid levels,” the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in its half-yearly report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for July-December of fiscal year 2021-22 released on Friday.\n\nOver 70% of Pakistani workers go to GCC countries mostly to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nThe number of migrating Pakistani workers plunged to zero during the initial five months of the pandemic – April-August 2020, according to the central bank’s report.\n\nThe normalisation of the flow of workers to foreign countries along with a surge in the income of oil exporting GCC countries indicates the inflow of workers’ remittances to Pakistan will remain steady at around “$32 billion in the current fiscal year 2023 compared to $31 billion in FY22”, Topline Research projected last week.\n\nAs many as 458,257 Pakistanis proceeded abroad for employment in the first seven months (January-July) of 2022. This translates into 65,465 in each of the seven months, according to the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment’s (BE&OE) official website.\n\nA record high number of 946,571 Pakistanis went abroad for employment in 2015, translating to 78,881 each month during the year, according to the Bureau.\n\nAccording to the SBP report, it took almost two years to normalise the monthly flow of Pakistani migrants for work to the Middle Easter countries to pre-pandemic level. It was January 2020 when around 65,000 Pakistani went abroad for job purposes last time before the outbreak of the virus in Pakistan in February 2020.\n\nThe central bank’s report said no word on the economic outlook for the current fiscal year 2023, as it usually does in its quarterly, half-yearly and annual reports. Instead, it gave an outdated outlook for the second half (January-June) of FY22.\n\nTo recall, the country achieved economic growth of 6% for the second consecutive fiscal year in 2021-22.\n\nThe central bank said in its latest State of Pakistan’s Economy report that the collection of revenue in taxes to the government increased notably, but mostly due to increased imports during the first half of the previous fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. \n\nFederal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) collection of revenue in taxes increased by 32% in the first half of FY22, notwithstanding somewhat slower growth in the second quarter (Oct-Dec FY22), as economic activities improved and general price levels rose as compared to last year.\n\n“However, most of this increase stemmed from import-related taxes, on account of the broad-based increase in import volumes, international commodity prices, and PKR (Pakistani rupee) depreciation,” SBP said in the report.\n\nThe government, however, sharply cut imports in the first month (July) of the current fiscal year 2022 to $4.9 billion to avert the risk of default on international payments ahead of the resumption of IMF’s extended $7 billion loan programme in last week of the current month of August 2022.\n\nThe imports had hit a five-month high at $2.3 billion in June.\n\nFinance Minister Miftah Ismail said the other day the curb on imports would remain in place over the next three to four-month to improve the country’s capacity to make import payments and foreign debt 946,571 repayments.\n\nThe import curtailment may compromise FBR collection of revenue in taxes in the three to fourth-month of low imports in FY23.\n\nFrom the perspective of the first half of FY22, the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) exhibited broad-based expansion, exports grew buoyant alongside growth in FBR taxes and Kharif crops recorded higher production, the central bank said.\n\nHowever, amid multi-year high global commodity prices, rising inflation and current account deficit posed a challenge as the year progressed, it said.\n\n“These pressures necessitated monetary tightening amidst other regulatory measures to moderate demand.”­­\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 13th, 2022.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/41660337318-0/41660337318-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Senate panel seeks details of PIA pilots", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2310861/senate-panel-seeks-details-of-pia-pilots", "date_published": "Fri, 16 Jul 21 06:16:48 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Senate Standing Committee on Aviation on Thursday sought details of the pilots working with the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and was briefed on the functions of the Aviation Division and its attached departments.\n\nThe committee meeting, chaired by Hidayatullah, reviewed working procedures, budget, number of employees, challenges faced by the Aviation Division and its subsidiaries and the performance of the institutions.\n\nAmong others, the meeting was attended by senators Syed Muhammad Sabir Shah, Faisal Saleem Rehman, Mian Raza Rabbani, Aun Abbas, Faisal Javed, Saleem Mandviwalla, Afnanullah Khan, Dilawar Khan and Sherry Rehman, besides Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Aviation Secretary Ali, Adviser to CEO PIA Amir Hayat, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Director General Flight Lieutenant (retd) Khaqan Murtaza, Airport Security Force chief security officer, Pakistan Meteorological Department director general and other senior officials.\n\nIt also looked into the measures taken by the Aviation Division to improve performance of the attached departments and its future plans to tackle challenges confronted on the professional front.\n\nIt was the committee's first meeting after its reconstitution followed by the Senate elections.\nHidayatullah said the committee proceedings would be made more effective with mutual consultation of the members so that the confronted issues could be removed in an efficient manner.

Kamran Ghulam\n\nKamran Ghulam may not be a household name yet since he hasn’t represented Pakistan national team till now, but people who follow domestic cricket closely know him as the next big thing.\n\nThe right-handed batsman, in the recently concluded Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, bettered the record for most runs in a single QeA Trophy season. The record, earlier held by Saadat Ali with 1217 runs, was broken by Ghulam in the final of the tournament where he was representing Khyber-Pakhtukhwa.\n\nHowever, this is not the only thing that pushed Wasim to include the 25-year-old in the squad.\n\nGhulam boasts a first-class average of over 53 with 31 matches to his name. He has scored nine 100s and 11 fifties to amass 2,413 runs, with a highest score of 166.\n\nIf he can build on his current domestic form when playing against South Africa, the visitors will find it hard to beat Pakistan in the two-Test series.\n\n2. Tabish Khan\n\nIf you’re a pacer outside Pakistan, you’ll probably start your career in mid or late-twenties and end it after your mid-thirties. However, right-arm medium pacer Tabish Khan will start his international career at 36.\n\nSome may say he was not international material, but with 598 wickets in 137 first-class matches, there is and there never was a valid reason to keep him out of the national fray. Well, he’s not the only one who had to wait a long time to get his chance, Fawad Alam is another case study in this regard too.\n\nThere is light at the end of every tunnel and Tabish had to travel miles to find his light and he would love to grab the chance with both hands when he bowls to the South Africans in Karachi and Rawalpindi in the two Tests.\n\nJury is out on whether he will be able to live up to the hype after spending his heydays in the domestic wilderness, but if Tabish wants to question a system which gives multiple chances to a few and nearly zero to some, he will have to utilise all the experience he has gained and get his first and maybe final hurrah on the international level.\n\n3. Saud Shakeel\n\nAnother youngster, with heaps of runs behind him and a first-class average of nearly 49, Saud Shakeel will don the greens of Pakistan during the two Tests against South Africa.\n\nAt the age 25, Shakeel has 3220 runs in his books in 46 first-class outings. He also has 10 tons and 17 fifties to boast about and if this is not enough, he can bowl left-arm slow.\n\nShakeel has come to the fore through the Pakistan cricket ranks and has played for the U19 team, which may prove to be a point in his favour as he had the grooming of a cricketer from an early age.\n\nAll in all, Pakistan have played a big gamble by benching their usual suspects and giving the domestic performers a chance to shine. This move may turn new chief selector Wasim into a hero that many were waiting for, however it can backfire too.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Kamran-Ghulam-PCB1611139704-0/Kamran-Ghulam-PCB1611139704-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "4 players who can help Pakistan beat New Zealand in third T20I", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2276840/4-players-who-can-help-pakistan-beat-new-zealand-in-third-t20i", "date_published": "Mon, 21 Dec 20 09:53:42 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan are against the ropes in the three-match T20I series against New Zealand as they’ve lost the opening two games and only a win in third shortest-format game can help them gain much-needed confidence when going into the Tests.\n\nPakistan stayed rigid in their approach and played the same elevens in the first two T20Is, but with the series already lost, it is high time Pakistan try something new on the field against New Zealand.\n\nWhile the option of chasing may present itself if Pakistan win the toss third time on the trot, a few changes in the eleven can also be beneficial for the stand-in captain Shadab Khan.\n\nHere are the three players who can walk in and help Pakistan win the third T20I against New Zealand.\n\n1. Sarfaraz Ahmed\n\nIf you ask a Pakistani cricket fan why Sarfaraz Ahmed was sent into the wilderness, even after taking Pakistan to the summit of the T20I rankings, they would not mention his batting, his wicketkeeping or his captaincy, but they’d rather blame it on him being a Karachi player.\n\nWhether this theory of the Pakistan Cricket Board being biased against Karachi players is true or not, one thing everyone can agree on is that Sarfaraz brings something to the field which many other players can’t – the much-needed energy.\n\nSarfaraz was famous for his animated and chatty wicketkeeping when he was captaining Pakistan in all formats and even though some may disagree, the energy he brought with his shenanigans was contagious.\n\nHim walking to the bowler before and after every delivery, his comments when someone dropped a catch or did a great job in the fielding, all of that is missed with Muhammad Rizwan behind the stumps.\n\nWith Shadab at the helm against a New Zealand side which he is finding very difficult to outwit, an experienced former captain behind the stumps can go a long way in helping Pakistan enforce a win when everything has failed to work.\n\n2 and 3. Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa\n\nWahab Riaz is not doing what he is supposed to do in New Zealand – be the experienced leader of the young bowling pack, and this gives way to Pakistan go for the young but express pace duo of Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa.\n\nInclusion of Musa can also help Shaheen Afridi take a much-needed rest before he is asked to run in and fire on all cylinders during the upcoming Tests.\n\nAlso, if Pakistan really want to make things interesting, they can always replace Haris Rauf with Iftikhar Ahmed. Iftikhar is considered to be a big-hitter, and also can bowl four overs of off-spin. Since New Zealand are perfectly fine when dealing with pacers, a spin of strategy may work in Pakistan’s favour.\n\n4. Usman Qadir\n\nWe all saw what the legendary spinner Abdul Qadir’s son Usman Qadir got from his father – a spin bowling masterclass.\n\nShadab has been off colour in the bowling department in the first two matches, maybe because of his increased focus on batting and recently captaincy and Usman can help fill the shoes of team’s first-choice leggie.\n\nIf there’s a question of who he should replace in the side, anyone between Khushdil Shah and Abdullah Shafique can give way to Usman, as many may still now know that he has the ability to bat quite nicely in the lower order.\n\nPakistan will be concluding their shortest-format series in the third T20I against New Zealand on Tuesday and they will need something new to surprise the hosts and make them submit. However, if they play safe and don’t make any changes, they will surely lose again, with dignity yes, but they will lose.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/comment1608542933-0/comment1608542933-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "3 reasons Pakistan lost first T20I against New Zealand", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2276467/3-reasons-pakistan-lost-first-t20i-against-new-zealand", "date_published": "Fri, 18 Dec 20 12:36:48 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThere was never a doubt that Pakistan would find it difficult to beat New Zealand at the latter’s home and the theory was proven true when the Kiwis beat Men in Green by five wickets in the first T20I of the three-match series on Friday.\n\nWith the defeat, Pakistan will have to pull up their socks for the next two T20Is if they want to salvage the series and win it.\n\nIt was also a sad day for Pakistan stand-in captain Shadab Khan who lost the very first T20I, where he stood as captain.\n\nA closer look of the first T20I shows there were a few things Pakistan could have changed or could have done to prevent the loss in the tour opener.\n\n1. No specialist openers\n\nPakistan won the toss and chose to bat first, but they missed the trick when they asked wicketkeeper-batsman Muhammad Rizwan and newcomer Abdullah Shafique to open the innings against New Zealand.\n\nUnfamiliar with the opening role, Rizwan lost his wicket due to a callous drive and a smart delivery by Jacob Duffy, while Shafique was found out in the second delivery he faced against the Kiwis. Shafique couldn’t fathom the bounce on the pitch and flighted one into the hands of mid-on fielder for an easy catch.\n\nWith the openers gone quickly, as has been the case for Pakistan since eternity, the middle-order, lacking the services of the great Babar Azam, fell like a deck of cards, thus the question of why did Pakistan go with two batsmen upfront who don’t understand the demands of the opener’s role.\n\n2. Batting failure (again)\n\nWith the openers gone, the onus fell on the middle-order to stabilise the innings, but a young Haider Ali was not up to the task. Here, once again, Pakistan did not think twice before sending him at the one-down position, where teams tend to send their best and most in-form batsman.\n\nHaider is all that and a little more, but he lacks the experience of playing at the third spot. However, the next best option to bat at number three, veteran Muhammad Hafeez, did equally bad in batting after being dismissed on the very first ball he faced.\n\nAll thanks to Shadab’s 42 off 32 and a late flurry by Faheem Ashraf, who scored 31 off 18, Pakistan were able to put up a fighting total, but if the top and upper middle-order would have added an extra 20 or 30, the match could’ve shifted in the visitors’ favour.\n\n3. The Wahab dilemma\n\nTo play him or not to play him has become one of the major questions Pakistan faces whenever they go out in the field. If Afridi’s is the pinnacle of mercurial batting, Wahab is all that in the bowling department.\n\nOne day, he would pluck the moon out of the sky for Pakistan and the next day he would turn a certain victory into a miraculous defeat. Is it just bad luck, or is it just his bad bowling at some points, no one can truly answer.\n\nThe latter happened on Friday, when Wahab gave away 45 runs in just 3.5 overs after being hit for two sixes and five fours. New Zealand batsmen were bamboozled in the middle of the innings by some top-notch bowling by Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Faheem Ashraf, but Wahab leaking away runs gave New Zealand the much-needed confidence.\n\nAnd if all that was not enough, Faheem dropped a catch off Wahab at fine leg and to add insult to injury, let the ball crawl away for a four.\n\nIt is quite evident now that people are prone to dropping catches off Wahab’s bowling at fine leg and square leg region. Everyone would remember the disastrous drop in the 2015 World Cup by Rahat Ali where Wahab had setup Shane Watson perfectly with world class short-pitched bowling.\n\nSo, do we curse the man or do we curse his luck, at least I can’t answer this dilemma.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/comment1608294842-0/comment1608294842-0-68779.jpg"}, {"headline": "3 reasons Pakistan will find it difficult to beat New Zealand", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2274087/3-reasons-pakistan-will-find-it-difficult-to-beat-new-zealand", "date_published": "Mon, 30 Nov 20 07:44:32 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan contingent is currently in quarantine in New Zealand as they prepare for face the hosts in three T20Is and two Tests, and there is only one thing that is certain in the current uncertain Covid-19 time – it won’t be easy to beat the Kiwis.\n\nHere are the three main reasons why Babar Azam can return winless, in the series and in all the T20Is and Tests, from New Zealand.\n\n1. Bad morale\n\nAfter news of Pakistani players testing positive surfaced, the team must have seen a fall in their morale as, according to reports, many first team players were affected with the virus.\n\nThis could have led to drop in motivation, while a warning to send the whole squad home after some players breached the Covid-19 protocol was also not inspiring.\n\nPakistan players may be pumped up to beat New Zealand in the latter’s own yard after such humiliation, but with players in gloomy isolation, losing hope and feeling down may be the most probable outcome of the saga.\n\n2. Lack of fitness and practice\n\nEveryone knows about Pakistani’s love for food and our cricketers are just humans. With nothing much to do in hotel rooms, food might be the only entertainment they’ve had through the first half of their quarantine. Hence, a lack of practice may cause lethargy when they hit the ground.\n\nAll this may result in lack of efforts in the field and as the adage of catches win matches goes, a few slipups are a possibility too.\n\nPakistani players will have to put some extra yards in before the matches, otherwise, if they do just enough, the performances will also be just enough and New Zealand will roll over the Men in Green with ease.\n\n3. New Zealand’s form\n\nNew Zealand may not have won many global cricketing tournaments, but they are not known for their big trophy cabinet, they are known for their consistency.\n\nIf they are not the best on a given day, you can surely expect them to be at their minimum best at least. Meanwhile, their opponents Pakistan are known to be the most mercurial cricketing side in the world – “one minute down, next minute up”.\n\nIt is this consistency in New Zealand’s performance that makes them a difficult side to beat and add home advantage to that and it becomes a perfect recipe for Pakistan’s destruction in the series.\n\nAlso, they are unbeaten in the T20Is in the series against West Indies. Their form can be seen in the fact that they have scored quickly in the first two matches, setting a 239-run target in first and chasing a 180-run target in just 16 overs in the second.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistani players last played cricket during the remaining matches of the PSL5.\n\nMomentum will be on New Zealand’s side when they host Pakistan, first for T20Is and then for Tests. Babar will have to come up with a magical formula to lift the spirit of the players who will be feeling under the weather, homesick, and also out of form and practice. If the skipper can do that then he may not only go on to become a batting legend, but also a captain whose name would be written in golden words.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Comment1606722149-0/Comment1606722149-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Is Trump right in saying ‘India is filthy’?", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2270253/is-trump-right-in-saying-india-is-filthy", "date_published": "Wed, 28 Oct 20 13:11:05 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhile the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden produced fireworks, Trump’s remarks in the environmental context that “India is filthy”, became a matter of heated debate within Indian media. Indian social media went berserk and its reaction also became prominent on mainstream media. Some went on to ask Trump for an apology on these remarks, which most of Sanghi trolls thought had hurt millions of common Indians.\n\nWhile any nation would react to such remarks from any leader of global stature, Trump’s remarks had a profound effect as Mr Modi has done a lot of work to develop a personal relationship with Trump through the “Howdy,Modi!” rally in the United States and “Namaste Trump” programme duringTrump’s visit to India this year.\n\nWhile we respect Indian sentiments, it may be interesting to conduct an analysis of where does India stand in terms of cleanliness and environment.\n\nAccording to IndiaSpend’sState of Global Air 2020 report,116,000 infants died in India due to air pollution in 2019 — meaning one infant died every five minutes due to air pollution. The data further reveals that 1.67 million Indians died in 2019 due to air pollution causes.\n\nAs per a World Health Organisation report, approximately 120,000 children under the age of five years die due to diarrhoea every year. This indicates that waterborne diseases are rampant in India due to contaminated water and poor sanitation.Hookworms, which can spread through open defecation, cause diarrhoea, anaemia and weight loss in women, according to the report. These problems are linked to low birth weight and slow child growth — 38% of children in India under five are stunted, according to the National Family Health Survey data.\n\nThe Indian magazine, The Wire, reported in 2017, that India, the world’s second-largest country by population, had the highest number of people (732 million) without access to toilets. The report by WaterAid, titled “Out Of Order: The State of the World’s Toilets 2017”, further stated that 355 million women and girls lacked access to a toilet. If they were to stand in a line, the queue could circle the Earth more than four times.\n\nThe problem is that Modi’sSwachh Bharat or Clean India programme built millions of toilets at avery fast pace across Indian landscape; however, these have become dilapidated and unusable,adding to the problem. Adding to that is the factor of demographics: Indian population has grown from 1,330 million in 2017 to 1,380 million in 2019, that’s an additional load of 50 million. So even if India builds one million new toilets every year it cannot match the pace of population growth.\n\nA CNet report published on September 11, 2020, states that India spent $30 billion to fix its broken sanitation. It ended up with more problems. The Swachh Bharat mission, launched in 2014, was an ambitious effort to stop open defecation. It's far from reaching that goal.Lack of enough water to use in Swachh Bharat was bound to make it a failure. Imagine a community toilet built for 500 people in a cramped city with irregular or no supply of water. Within a week, it will not only become unusable but also become a source of disease spread. A survey of open source pictures and videos of Swachh Bharat toilets in overpopulated cities indicates that this grand programme has become a virtual dustbin.\n\nIn 2019, India was also home to 21 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities, studies say, based on air-quality data. Coal usage in power generation stands at a whopping 75% and coal is notoriously bad for environment. No wonder New Delhi maintains the record of being the most polluted capital of the world for the second consecutive year. Even drinking water of the Indian capital is contaminated, The Hindu, in 2019,sarcastically remarked, “If it wasn’t enough that Delhi air is among the world’s most polluted, a new study has now shown that the city’s tap water is the most unsafe among 21 states within India.”\n\nIndian rivers have become almost toxic due to overpopulation and flow of sewage and industrial waste into rivers which hug large cities.Oceanplasticcleanup.com conducted a study of the most filthy, polluted and toxic rivers in the world called the “Dirty Dozen”, and lo and behold, India gets another honour with the Ganges as the second most polluted river in the world and Yamuna as the fifth filthiest.\n\nThe Ganges has a perennial problem of religious rituals.Gangapollution.com keeps a watch on issues related to it. One of its report highlighted the pollution in Indian rivers: many parts of the Hindu faith revolve around the Ganges River, who they believe is the form of the goddess Mother Ganga on Earth. Because of this, many people’s bodies and ashes are placed in the river. Large amounts of ashes from crematoriums along the Ganges River in Varanasi are dumped in each year. Majority of Hindus are cremated and placed in the river after being burned by Dalits along the ghats leading into their goddess’ body. These ashes are keeping the river from being clean.\n\nDead bodies are also a huge pollutant to the already dirty water, with 35,000 bodies estimated to be discarded into the river,yearly. This is huge amount of dead people to be floating in an important source of water for millions of people. Many times, international observers have pointed out to the Indian government to take effective measures for respect of human remains as pictures of human bodies floating in the Ganges River surface almost every month.\n\nOther than air pollution, poor sanitation, filthy rivers and water contamination, India stands tall in noise population as well.A LiveMintreport on noise pollution in India describes an alarming picture.\n\nThe red light at a traffic junction is the universal sign for vehicles to stop — but in India, it is also a signal to start something else: relentless honking. When noise from constant honking is added to the general cacophony in cities, it becomes noise pollution — and this pollution can be costly and dangerous too.\n\nKnops.co conducts regular surveys of noise pollution across the globe. Its 2018 report puts India in the top noise polluted countries in the world. The Worldwide Hearing Index was created some time ago by digital hearing app founders, Mimi Hearing Technologies GmbH. They analysed the hearing test results of 200,000 of their users. They combined their results with data on noise pollution from WHO and SINTEF, a Norwegian-based research organisation, and used it to plot noise pollution in 50 different cities. The top five cities with the worst noise pollution include Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nTo conclude, President Trump may have casually mentioned ‘filthy India’, referring to environmental issues without much attention to research and scientific evidence, but he has been proven right. India tops the list of the most polluted countries in the world in sanitation, water, air, hygiene and even noise.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2182545-adeelanaureennew-1584984008.jpg"}, {"headline": "Why we need fear for effective disaster risk reduction", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2268212/why-we-need-fear-for-effective-disaster-risk-reduction", "date_published": "Tue, 13 Oct 20 13:18:35 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tToday is the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and living in a time of a global pandemic, the need to prioritise disaster risk reduction has become resounding and all too very real as almost every person and community is suffering from institutional and socio-economic lack of preparedness. \n\nPandemics are not new. Scientists and historians have been warning against a global novel virus for the past few decades. Beating their beakers and drums, trying to raise awareness among governments and businesses that this is not of a matter of if, but when. When the Ebola outbreak wreaked havoc in West Africa, the US State Department, under then president Barack Obama’s administration developed a comprehensive guide in dealing with and mitigating infectious diseases. This was of course completely thrown out by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nOn October 8, just a few days ago, Pakistan saw the clock tick to 15 years since the devastating earthquake of 2005. Pakistan bore colossal losses then. Nearly 20,000 children died while they were attending classes. In total, about 85,000 people died, another 140,000 injured and 3.5 million became homeless as 0.6 million houses were severely damaged.\n\nPakistan’s north was particularly devastated and Balakot, the epicentre, was destroyed in a matter of seconds and 15 years on is still struggling to re-build infrastructure and lives. There is hardly any significant rehabilitation or reconstruction. Rather, the funds that were allotted for Balakot’s rehabilitation have been redistributed to the Benazir Income Support Programme(BISP) and Covid-19 Emergency Fund. This speaks to how ill-prepared our DRR is, that funds for one disaster are siphoned for others.\n\nDRR is an incredibly lofty goal for a country that cannot rehabilitate its citizens from disasters that took place almost two decades ago. Pakistan is not the only country unable to learn from past mistakes and lack of preparedness. As stated above, the US, and rather most countries during the Covid-19 pandemic have proven the amnesia that collectively surrounds us when it comes to the destruction of disasters.\n\nDanish philosopherSørenKierkegaard makes a distinction between the concept of dread and fear calling attention to fear as having an object, a definable threat that we can identify. Whereas, dread is a response shrouded in unknowns, is speculative, not belonging to parameters or definitions. \n\nWe are unequivocally living in a global time of fear. We fear the coronavirus, we fear loss of jobs, lives, travel, routine, any semblance to the “old normal”. Our fear is driving conversations and changes around the “Great Reset”: how can this disaster be learned from in such a way that we build back the world, better?\n\nWhat can be changed about the status quo that protects citizens beyond economic and political interests? \n\nHow can this ‘new’normal truly be transformative and inclusive?\n\nFear’s object allows for these conversations to have actionable points and attainable goals. Fear makes having a game-plan easier. Fear divides people into groups of: ‘part of the solution’ or ‘part of the problem,’ as is evidenced by corona-shaming of non-mask wearers and political leaders who had to retract fake news and disinformation.\n\nDRR for objects of fear, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, is timely and due to its global nature, which unlike Ebola which was predominantly contained within the context of “poor” countries, Covid-19’s fear is ubiquitous and has spread to contexts that are not used to suffering —‘developing country’ailments. The politics of fear is also always at play. Who is fearful,who is bearing the brunt of the threat is always imperative. Thus, DRR for infectious diseases is at the forefront of the priority list and perhaps, rightly so.\n\nDread on the other hand, is objectless, casting anxiety far and wide without aim and thus, is much more insurmountable than fear. Many of us dread climate change in an abstract way. We hear the news of sea levels rising. We notice the irregularities of the seasons. We breathe in toxic air like it is a non-negotiable aspect of nature. We watch gut-wrenching clips of starving farmers and drowning residents. \n\nOften though these realities are not directly our own. The dread and threat of climate change is still far away, neatly tucked away somewhere in the future. This is why business-as-usual is the state of affairs when it comes to the economy, government, consumer behaviour and social order. \n\nDRR for dread does not have the same timely impact as DRR for fear.\n\nUnlike DRR for infectious diseases, DRR for climate change is failing to account for human, social and political disaster amnesia.\n\nWhen dread turns to fear, as one may have experienced during the recent floods that engulfed Karachi and other parts of the country, there is suddenly an actionable sensibility that grips citizens and governments alike. Especially when those citizens were elites and urbane. The problem solving caps come on as people are united against a common threat.\n\nHowever, as human populations have made unprecedented exponential advancements in the last three decades, the myriad of threats have also of course, multiplied. Existential threats such as Artificial Intelligence, climate change, cyber warfare, pandemics, to name a few, have caused mounting existential dread invariably leading to inertia of sorts.\n\nI guess the trillion dollar question is: how do we capture what we know about the difference between fearand dread to formulate and implement DRR that works with the psychology and sociology of communities and countries?\n\nThis year, the theme of the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction is governance which is defined as the measure by which“lives are saved, reduced numbers of disaster-affected people and reduced economic losses. Covid-19 and the climate emergency are telling us that we need a clear vision, plans and competent, empowered institutions acting on scientific evidence for the public good.”\n\nUnfortunately, we are all still enveloped in a fear-centric mode of thinking when it comes to DRR. For instance, Prime Minister Imran Khan has recently approved the construction of high-rise buildings in Islamabad. This is problematic for several reasons from a DRR and urban planning perspective.\n\nFirstly, contrary to popular opinion, high-rises are not green solutions. In fact, high-rises encourage vehicular clutter causing serious damage to both environment and humans alike, by increasing air pollution. Vertical urban sprawl wreaks havoc on air quality. \n\nSecondly, high-rise buildings are energy-intensive as glass is simply not very good at keeping excessive heat out, or desirable heat in. Even with technological advancement, the amount of power it takes to keep high-rises going poses a huge opportunity cost to greener solutions. \n\nLastly, Pakistan has many seismic zones and as many high-rises are vulnerable to earthquakes and not always structurally sound, the proliferation of high-rises in the country can pose mammoth near-future risks. Furthermore, high-rises, pose evacuation concerns. If you live or work in a high-rise apartment, you'll face a harder challenge trying to evacuate due to emergencies, such as natural disasters or fire.\n\nIt is said, “earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings do,” which begs the question why is our government taking urban planning measures that are increasing disaster risks rather than reducing them?\n\nOur Prime Minister has repeatedly said, “ghabrana nahi hai (don’t get scared)”; but, when it comes to disaster risk reduction, it would be very wise to be fearful.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Mavra-Bari1602595736-0/Mavra-Bari1602595736-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Public complaints", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2265484/public-complaints", "date_published": "Thu, 24 Sep 20 19:06:54 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn order to further facilitate the public and speed up redressal of their grievances, the government plans to link up all complaint management systems of federal ministries with the Pakistan Citizen Portal. Prime Minister Imran Khan recently issued instructions in this regard. All existing 33 complaint cells of federal ministries will be connected with the centralised complaint system. The PM’s Performance Delivery Unit (PMDU) will decide the modalities in consultation with relevant institutions and devise integration plans. The PMDU has been asked to complete the process within 60 days. The idea is to avoid delays resulting from a multiplicity of complaint cells and duplication of efforts thereby undertaking the process of complaint rectification on a fast track basis. This will also save time and resources. The purpose is to put in place a universal system with many-faceted connectivity features for a comprehensive global grievance redressal mechanism.\n\nThe centralised system will help citizens avoid confusion as now a number of complaint cells are functioning causing problems to both the people and government functionaries working for redressal of public grievances. The integrated system will help eliminate the delays involved in manual processing of complaints. It will bring the whole process of receipt, processing, and removal of complaints under one window, and help citizens get information about the status of their complaints and things related to them. The PCP started functioning as part of the PMDU from October 2018. During the past two years, as many as 28 million people have registered 115,000 complaints, on average, every month, with it. According to official figures, 2.2 million complaints have been resolved with 40% confirmed satisfaction. The rural population might not be getting the facility of the online PCP because of the unavailability of internet services in villages and small towns. This needs to be rectified.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, September 25th, 2020.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "Jodhpur killing", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2265483/jodhpur-killing", "date_published": "Thu, 24 Sep 20 19:06:21 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistani Hindus have begun protesting against the Jodhpur incident as well as the hardships faced by members of the minority community that migrated to India in search of a better life. The false dreams that many of them have are regularly shattered by the harsh reality of India’s still-strong caste system, which rarely allows lower-caste Hindus to rise. Many of the Pakistani Hindu migrants are from those lower castes. For this, they often end up having to wait for decades to be allowed to become citizens of a country that claims to welcome all Hindus.\n\nPakistan Hindu Council Patron-In-Chief Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani made a much more explosive claim that Indian intelligence agencies have been forcing Pakistani Hindu migrants and tourists to speak against Pakistan and even killing people who refuse to do so. As evidence, Vankwani referred to the last month’s case of 11 members of a family who died under mysterious circumstances in the Indian city of Jodhpur in Rajasthan. The family had moved there years ago, motivated by those same false promises of a better life in India. Instead, they ended up being poisoned in their home.\n\nThe case itself is interesting for the secretive manner in which India has acted. The family of subsistence farmers was clearly not spies, yet India has refused to share any investigation details with Pakistan or allowed access to the survivors, even though they all were still Pakistani citizens at the time they died.\n\nVankwani implied that this was because a surviving family member had nominated the RSS and the ruling BJP in the police report. He also noted that no arrests had been made in the case which is extremely concerning.\n\nAfter decades of throwing accusations about the treatment of Hindus in neighbouring Muslim countries, India has shown that it is just as dangerous.

However, while many of the more prominent voices making those calls may appear to have a direct stake in the game — such as the PTI’s political rivals — the truth is that rumours have surrounded the finances of most other major political parties as well. Contrast that with political activists and others who have been calling for reforms for decades, yet have been largely ignored by the powers that be. \n\nClean elections and good governance should not be partisan issues. Unfortunately, failure to update election and political financing laws, or even enforce existing ones, is a collective failure of the political parties and the bureaucracy because it deprives citizens of their basic rights, while also ensuring that truly independent candidates from middle-class or poor backgrounds just can’t compete with the big guns. But maybe that is the point — securing the positions of the ruling elite while also ensuring that they stay in line. \n\nOver the weekend, open government and election transparency advocates at the Free and Fair Election Network , or Fafen, also brought up how political parties inside and outside the parliament need to strengthen regulations to limit the ability of big spenders to virtually buy elections, warning that free-spending without consequences deprives citizens of the right to contest elections and skews results towards big spenders, regardless of whether they are backed by billionaires or smaller, individual donors. \n\nThe weaknesses in the system begin with the current iteration of the law governing elections — the Elections Act of 2017. The act is astoundingly weak in its grants of regulatory power, and can be directly blamed — along with its authors — for allowing the 2018 general election to turn into the biggest spending polling cycles in the country’s history, even when inflation is taken into account. Bye-elections and local bodies polls conducted since then have also seen unprecedented spending, effectively consolidating power among the ultra-rich, whether directly as candidates or through the political parties they bankroll. Strongly enforced spending caps can be problematic in bigger constituencies and areas with higher advertising costs, but they are still probably the easiest place to start. \n\nDonor transparency is another area which needs to be investigated. This could be done through a public database which parties and candidates must regularly update with every political donation received and details of how funds are spent. The same would also apply to private groups and individuals financing political campaigns. Criminal penalties, as long as they are fairly applied, would be more than enough to change the face of Pakistani electioneering, certainly making it cleaner and, hopefully, a little more representative.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 11th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "PDM fiddles while the economy burns", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369873/pdm-fiddles-while-the-economy-burns", "date_published": "Sat, 06 Aug 22 18:44:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe only thing seesawing faster than the Pakistani rupee right now is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s political capital. So, here’s a contrarian take on what’s happening to the Pakistani economy. The real crisis is one of confidence, and not just economic fundamentals. Consider this: Pakistan faced a similar economic crisis at the beginning of PTI’s term and then again at the beginning of Covid-19. In both cases, stability and economic growth were restored. In fact, unlike most countries where public debt rose significantly during Covid-19, we were able to reduce our public debt-to-GDP ratio by about five percentage points through Covid-19. So, why does this economic crisis feel like the end of the world?\n\nThe underlying crisis of confidence this time is rooted in politics versus economics. Let’s unpack the previous economic crisis Pakistan overcame to contextualise this one better. To simplify, PTI’s core challenge in 2018 was inheriting an unsustainable current account deficit with the country standing on the brink of dollar default, while PML-N’s core challenge was to reverse fuel subsidies. The first two years of PTI’s government were hard for our economy because PML-N gave an ailing economy to Asad Umar. \n\nThe primary challenge was a current account deficit of $20 billion thanks to Dar’s fixation on keeping the rupee artificially overvalued versus the dollar. An artificially high rupee meant it was cheaper to import things than to produce them in Pakistan or export goods. Hence, our industry hollowed out, exports declined during PML-N’s tenure and imports we couldn’t afford thrived, bringing us to the verge of bankruptcy when PTI took over. \n\nPTI took politically unpopular but wise decisions to correct these sins, including the painful devaluation of the currency. The idea was they would rescue the economy first, then stabilise and then put it on the growth path. Halfway through stabilisation, Covid-19 hit. Despite Covid-19 though, Pakistan clocked in growth at over 5% over the last two years. This was so good that PML-N argued last year that the numbers had been fudged by the PTI government, only to validate growth numbers this year after over-throwing the PTI government. PML-N even used these healthy growth numbers to secure the latest IMF deal. \n\nHowever, when the PML-N was strategising to overthrow PTI through a vote of no confidence, their primary argument was that PTI was mismanaging the economy and a competent team was needed to restore order. Four months later, we are experiencing the fruits of labour from team competence, with the rupee nosediving and inflation skyrocketing. \n\nIn a provocative recent column, former State Bank Governor, Raza Baqir asks why this crisis feels more dramatic when the economic fundamentals are actually better than before: ‘Given that we successfully restored stability and growth in the recent two challenging crises, why is there not a shared sense of calm confidence that we should be able to do the same this time round? This question is particularly relevant because our reserves and public debt are better today than they were in the 2019 balance-of-payments crisis before the start of the IMF programme. At end-June 2019, our gross reserves had dipped to around $7bn; at end-June 2022 they were around $10bn.’\n\nHe goes on to argue about the central role politics is playing in this crisis. And the next logical question to ask is what is the core driver of the political instability in the country today? The answer to that question is simple, the vote of no confidence against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The irony is that while PDM brought a no-confidence motion against Imran Khan, it’s the Pakistani economy that’s expressing no confidence in the PDM government today. If there’s one lesson everyone can learn from this train wreck, it’s that civilian Prime Ministers should be allowed to complete their five-year terms for both political and economic stability.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 7th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131.JPG"}, {"headline": "Afghan humanitarian crisis", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369656/afghan-humanitarian-crisis", "date_published": "Fri, 05 Aug 22 18:34:35 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfghanistan has a long history of destruction and suffering, be it man-inflicted or natural. Since the Russian invasion in December 1979, Afghanistan has become a battleground of world superpowers and is surrounded by an unending wave of destruction.\n\nAfter the foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan, Pakistan hosted an exclusive Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference to discuss the Afghanistan issue. The conference focused on the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and exploring new avenues to address the rapidly worsening humanitarian situation in terms of food shortage and potential economic collapse. Foreign ministers of member countries, special invitees from the United Nations (UN), international financial institutions, and non-member states, including the US, UK, European Union, and Russia attended the session. Afghanistan’s delegation was headed by the acting foreign minister.\n\nPakistan’s initiative to host the 17th session of the emergency meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the OIC demonstrated Pakistan’s strong will to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan. All member countries unanimously agreed that peace and stability in the region can only be achieved by forming a broad-based and inclusive government that is representative of the entire Afghan society. \n\nDecades of conflict and instability in Afghanistan have left millions of people on the brink of starvation. Some 24 million Afghans were already in need of humanitarian assistance because of the economic crisis and lack of development aid. The situation was further exacerbated after the recent earthquake in Paktia and Khost, which left nearly 1,500 dead and many more injured. \n\nFollowing the earthquake, the Afghan government appealed for international support to address the crisis. The Pakistani government responded immediately by dispatching consignments of relief goods. On 22nd June, the first convoy of 8 trucks carrying tents, tarpaulin, and blankets from the National Disaster Management Authority reached Afghanistan. On 24th June, another consignment of relief assistance was sent through aircraft. Besides this, Pak-Afghan Cooperation Forum (PACF) also sent 5 trucks carrying 37.5 tons of food, winter bedding, tents, tarpaulins, and clothes. \n\nEarlier, PACF had also organised free eye camps in the hospitals in Kabul and Khost where thousands of Afghan patients were provided free treatment by Pakistani doctors. The forum also facilitated the first batch of Afghan children with congenital diseases who will receive free medical treatment in Pakistan. \n\nTo promote bilateral trade with Afghanistan, the Pakistani government decided to relax the visa policy to ensure long-term and sustainable trade between the two countries. Under the new policy, six months of multiple entry visas will be issued to transporters from Afghanistan. Pakistan has also decided to import coal from Afghanistan, which can help Pakistan generate cheaper electricity and save nearly $2.3 billion. \n\nSince August 2021, the economic crisis and collapse of the banking sector have made it extremely challenging to get money into Afghanistan. International humanitarian organisations and the UN have scaled up assistance to address rising needs, but aid cannot replace the services of the state. To institutionalise financial support, a trust fund was established at the OIC conference. However, the international community remains reluctant to allow cash inflow.\n\nDuring this difficult time, the international community must lift sanctions and release Afghan funds as the country has descended into a serious economic crisis. The international community must realise that this is not the time to settle scores or debate on issues of legitimacy or recognition. They must resume aid and support the Afghan people to mitigate their miseries. \n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 6th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Javed-Iqbal1659724580-1/Javed-Iqbal1659724580-1.jpg"}, {"headline": "Dialogue urged to end political uncertainty", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369231/dialogue-urged-to-end-political-uncertainty", "date_published": "Wed, 03 Aug 22 07:47:41 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tChief of Qaumi Watan Party (QWP), Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao on Tuesday while showing concern over current political state of affairs, suggested a grand dialogue for all political par-\nties to ease the situation.\n\nTalking to media persons, Aftab Sherpao said if a grand dialogue among political entities was not held, it would be harmful for the country and its economy.\n\nSuggesting two resolutions to end wrangling between the political parties, Sherpao said in politics the doors of negotiations and dialogue were never kept closed.\n\nHe said if Hasina Wajid and Khaleda Zia could sit on one table in Bangladesh for the sake of their country, then why the government and opposition in Pakistan cannot have reconciliation dialogue.\n\nHe said the political mercury which has touched the new heights of confrontation needed to be brought down through talks.\n\nThe confronting politics, he said, have also badly hit the country’s economy that was a matter of great concern and must be understood by the politicians.

Recently, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the Padma Bridge and declared it a ‘symbol of pride and capacity’. As early as 1992, Sheikh Hasina was involved in the economic issues and plans for Bangladesh. She undertook the task of balancing economic policies with political implications. Sheikh Hasina shifted focus from her father’s socialist agenda toward market-based capitalist growth. She learnt from other Asian countries whose economic success was based upon four pillars: political stability, social development, trade liberalisation with export-led growth and fiscal restraint.\n\nDuring a conference, when an economist began informing her about the benefits of trade liberalisation, Sheikh Hasina quipped, “you don’t have to convince me about trade liberalisation. When I was living with my physicist husband in the Italian city of Trieste on the Yugoslavian border, I watched the border being opened three times a week and people travelling across from both sides, purchasing goods and return.” This demonstrates that Sheikh Hasina was assiduously focused on economics rather than other considerations that politicians are attracted to. \n\nEven though between 1971 to 2009, Bangladesh had hiccups in accountability campaigns and military rule, since 2009, the army has taken the back seat. Bangladesh has seen less frequent derailment of civilian governments and experienced little legitimisation and delegitimization of governments. Although its democratic history is not untainted, Bangladesh’s government has largely avoided public criticism about corruption and inefficiency. Despite having little experience in governance, the Prime Minister possessed visionary acuity and conviction that economic progress was the only way to alleviate poverty in the country. \n\nAlthough marred by allegations of coercion of opponents, after over fifteen years of sustained growth, Bangladesh has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Back in 1970, the country was 75% poorer compared to Pakistan but now it is 45% richer. In 1970, it had 10 million more mouths to feed but now its population is 170 million compared to Pakistan’s 230 million. In 2021, Bangladesh’s exports were $47 billion while Pakistan’s exports were $28 billion. The income per capita in Bangladesh is $2,227 compared to Pakistan’s $1,543. In 2022, its gross domestic product (GDP) is $411 billion compared to the $347 billion in Pakistan. The annual inflation rate is 6% compared to Pakistan’s previous 12-15%, which has now risen to 21% and is expected to further increase. Also, the Bangladeshi taka is much stronger compared to the Pakistani rupee. Importantly, Bangladesh has a strong literacy rate with high female participation in the economy.\n\nIn Pakistan, political parties have remained interested in personal gains. The repeated manipulation of the democratic process has stymied the growth of strong, democratic, and non-dynastic parties. It is worth recognising that economic growth is closely tied with political stability, rule of law, strong civilian institutions, and participatory democracy. Pakistan inherited an overdeveloped state with a feeble bourgeoise linked in a patron-client relationship with a powerful state. The country has inevitably witnessed an economic and political evolution marked by privilege and patronage. Agriculture and business incomes are primarily excluded from the tax net. There is an absence of progressive wealth tax and huge industrial and estate complexes are exempt from any levies. Our parliament is dominated by landlords, it is a small wonder that agriculture income tax has been relegated as an inconsequential subject to the provincial domain. Consequently, the tax net remains small as agriculture and industrial sectors are undertaxed.\n\nSince 1958, all experiments with the government have augmented feudal power instead of empowering the masses. The growth path pursued in Pakistan has been skewed in favour of the privileged, rich, and elite who must now make their fair contribution to the state. \n\nFollowing Bangladesh’s example, Pakistani leadership must pursue economic growth as the national agenda and adopt constitutionalism along with regional peace. Without compromising viable defence, adequate resources must be released for social and economic development. Considering that regional avenues of growth necessitate trade liberalisation, foreign trade agreements must be formed with India, Iran, China, Afghanistan, and other trading partners. Also, the export-led growth model should refocus on high-value-added goods.\n\nPakistan enjoys a comparative advantage in cheaper labour, which must be transformed to improve skills and productivity. Education and technical training for women must be promoted and adopted widely to increase women’s participation in the workforce. Also, a safe and legally conducive environment is crucial for foreign investments. \n\nA serious effort is required to levy a fair tax on agricultural incomes and the rich industrial cartels must make their due contribution to national wealth. Besides wealth and death taxes, large corporate and estate sectors need to be brought into the tax net.\n\nPakistan’s leadership can learn many lessons from Bangladesh’s experience, but the main takeaway should be that Sheikh Hasina prioritised economic growth, which is crucial for both defence and democracy.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 2nd, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Sahibzada-Riaz-Noor1655837455-1/Sahibzada-Riaz-Noor1655837455-1.jpg"}, {"headline": "A stitch in time", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368349/a-stitch-in-time", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Jul 22 19:56:55 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhen Imran Khan first came to power, he repeatedly lamented the insufficient political space to pursue his promised agenda. PTI was new to governance and struggled to find direction. This found comparisons with other governance models mostly bordering on unchecked power and singular control. The closest we come to it in a democracy is the presidential form but it sits against the ethos of a parliamentary governance model — more popularly accepted given our peculiar political environment. Legislation and parliamentary support for substantial reform stood unattended and PTI’s agenda remained undelivered. That was the moment to return to the electorate for a new mandate through a snap, mid-term or early election. He dithered and stalled till the chips fell. And then it was too late.\n\nToday the nation and the state is at a cross-road and most paths lead out to further disaster than seen in the last six months. It may be politics to those engaged in it but it spells life and death for a nation. There hasn’t been a more precarious moment in our national history. Politics, so used to arbitration, isn’t finding one at the moment — so controversial have the traditional points of mediation turned. The army and its leadership was maligned at will for the most part of the last six years. Any insinuation of the army’s leadership amounts to deliberate subversion, sedition and disruption in the military order. It is now a daily fodder. That the military politicised itself so much as to be a fair game is something for it to ponder over and deal with; but in a country where institutions have had to lend a hand in governance, their need to arbitrate when politicians feud will never go away. With such malicious and vicious attacks on it, the military has been literally neutralised.\n\nMaking courts controversial is the next ploy. The focus is on subverting the judiciary in public non-cooperation to contrive decisions of a side’s liking. A political system’s inability to resolve its own predicaments means that courts are asked to arbitrate. They are then framed for activism and judicial coups in public narrative when decisions don’t go their way. This is patent blackmail. In an environment where the economy is on the verge of crashing, if not already crashed, the threat of a default looms, 120 million people of Punjab have been without a functioning government for the last four months at the hands of political shenanigan-ism, the military is fighting a rear-guard action against terrorism in its midst, and the international environment is tenuous, fragile and laden against us politically and economically, governance is a non-functioning entity while politics is at best fratricidal and predatory. Those responsible for each of these, fiddle instead in crass opportunistic entanglement. There isn’t an institution left that has not been tarnished. So complete is the insinuation and slander. The crisis meanwhile only deepens and engorges us from all sides.\n\nThere are four possible ways-out from the current predicament:\n\n1) There can be a reset of the entire thing as has been the traditional resort when the army intervened and installed a transitional government after it had stalled into inaction. It has always left serious negative consequences to politics and governance in the country and skewed the balance of power unfairly. In the army itself the effects are substantively adverse and distasteful to its own professional culture. It is best avoided.\n\n2) The courts may declare a state of mis-governance in the country and an absence of a government that strictly conforms to the legal, constitutional and moral mandate to claim power. It may then emplace a national government composed of both political and non-political technocrats to fill-in for a period of 6 months to a year to reform and reset what has become broken in the normal course of things resulting in political stagnation. Historically, political classes have manipulated constitutional and legal statutes in their favour. Politics has also tended to corrupt the judicial system through inducement or fear of retribution or manipulation through parliamentary power to proverbially cut the wings of what is perceived a largely independent judiciary — a sine qua non in a democratic state. This option may seem appealing given our state of disorder and institutional break-down, though political parties for the most part will play spoilers to this arrangement by disassociating and disowning the reform process. Arbitrating structures must find a way to engage with political structures to make them a willing part of the process. A constitutional protection will be needed to safeguard any statutory recourse for making governance more sustainable and consistent.\n\n3) The third option is the Sri Lankan way. When the control of the government and its capacity to govern melted away, the only remaining power was that of the people on the streets. Law enforcement agencies could only do so much in the initial stages of the uprising but as soon as it got bigger and voluminous, law enforcement drew back to avoid bloodshed against its own citizens. The option engenders anarchy and chaos, and fragments a nation’s and a society’s core ethos as well as its physical and structural pillars. A nation may then dissolve and a state may cease to exist. In a nuclear-capable nation, it remains unthinkable and will invite intervention, even external. Although Imran Khan has waved this bogey often in a hope to elicit institutional support in favour of his political objectives, it remains a red-flag event needing constant monitoring. Khan has been very poorly and insidiously advised to use this option as a ploy. We have enough political and moral acumen in the country to save us from such a disastrous consequence.\n\n4) Our polity, so used to external arbitration, perhaps needs it the most in current times. It stands dysfunctional and polarised to the point of rupture. Seemingly there exists little possibility for political players to come together in consensus on critical issues. Such is the intensity and depth of the divide. Yet it remains the only saviour out of our debilitating predicament. The President, the army, and the judiciary will need to come together at this precarious moment beyond their respective constitutional domains to avoid a multi-sectoral meltdown of the state and the nation. The agreed mechanism in the 1973 constitution continues to be either subverted or manipulated for political favour, forcing resort to the judiciary for adjudication. Necessary tweaking of laws and statutes may be needed in a consensus to enable sustainable, resilient, transparent and effective governance both at the center and in the provinces. Early elections and a new mandate are essential for a credible government to carry an effective voice with multilateral and bilateral partners.\n\nA half derelict non-concern for a free-falling economy by the government seems more a ploy to keep the powers-that-be interested in rushing the props to keep the government in place. Such purposed neglect is insidious and needs immediate redressal. We cannot sit idly by as negative politics unravels the order. A stitch in time will save us some more.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 29th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Shahzad-Chaudhry1592677757-0/Shahzad-Chaudhry1592677757-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan pulls out of India chess event", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2368293/pakistan-pulls-out-of-india-chess-event", "date_published": "Thu, 28 Jul 22 06:50:07 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan have withdrawn from the world's biggest international chess tournament in protest at hosts India holding a torch relay for the event through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Thursday.\n\nThe 44th Chess Olympiad will see over 1,700 players from 188 nations compete in Chennai from now until August 10.\n\nThe last two competitions were played virtually because of the pandemic.\n\nThe Kashmir dispute has weathered decades of violence and upheaval since it was partitioned between India and Pakistan when both countries became independent in 1947.\n\nThe neighbours both claim it in full and have fought two of their three wars over control of the territory.\n\n\"By passing the torch relay through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir...

And yet, the military-industrial complex continues to thrive, elite capture remains elusive, and the juggernaut of divisive politics continues to cause fissures in our cultural zeitgeist. A colossal amount of black money — Pakistan’s illegitimate parallel economy — remains unseen, unreported and untaxed. Whether we are a police officer or a judge, a petty officer or a general, a building contractor or a factory owner, we continue to lie, cheat and defraud others and our country on our way to achieving our goals. Our economy and our morality both are on the cusp of default. As a society, we cannot stoop lower.\n\nIf there is one trait that defines political leadership like none other, it is narcissism. In our frenzied political landscape, knocking at the door of the Supreme Court has become an obsessive-compulsive ritual. If our politicians don’t get what they want, they are quick to approach the highest bench. Regardless of which party they belong to, if the judges rule in their favour, they are hailed as honest and impartial; if the judgements go against them, the same judges are deemed as partial and biased.\n\nOn July 22, a letter was waved once again, this time in the chamber of the Punjab Assembly. This time, it was the Hamza-Elahi face-off. We were back to watching television news shows where uncouth tirades were interrupted by even more uncouth tirades hurled by so-called political pundits. But here is the gist of the problem: legal discussions on the constitutionality of a matter are enlightening, they’re a thing of beauty; but when polluted by partisanship, these same discussions lose their intellectual value.\n\nWhy are politicians so obsessed with hanging on to power? The answer lies in the question itself: power. And this brings me to the power paradox which simply means that we act with empathy and modesty at first but quickly turn to coercion, manipulation and exploitation as soon as we acquire power. Whether we are corporate executives or CEOs, monarchs or political leaders, or even patriarchs in a patriarchal society, the power paradox applies to all of us. Inherent within us is a proclivity for pathological addiction to power, vanity and self-importance.\n\nIs greed a precursor to the power paradox? Is greed the driving force for success? Gordon Grekko, a character played by Michael Douglas in the movie Wall Street, puts it bluntly when he says, “the point is ladies and gentlemen that greed is, for lack of a better word, good.” The fact remains that we are rats in a rat race. Greed feeds our egos. Greed also divides us between the haves and the have-nots, between the exploiters and the exploited. Karl Marx was prophetic about our fate under capitalism: “Money is the universal, self-constituted value of all things. It has therefore robbed the whole world, human as well as natural, of its own values.”\n\nOut of hope or despair, we follow political leaders only to be ushered to the innermost circle of hell. On the one hand, we have political clans that remind us of the Sicilian mafia, the Cosa Nostra. On the other hand, we have a self-aggrandising braggart who shares a passing resemblance with Mussolini. We gather in thousands and listen to them deliver inspiring speeches just like Hitler did about a hundred years ago or Donald Trump more recently. They promise to save our country, to restore our lost glory, our greatness and excellence, while they make secret deals behind closed doors in the dead of the night.\n\nIn Botan Doro, a chilling ghost story, a handsome Japanese samurai falls in love with a beautiful girl carrying a lantern who visits his town every night but disappears before dawn. Smitten with her charm, he chases her down. They begin to spend the nights together. One early morning, the samurai’s nosy neighbour sneaks into his house and finds him dead in his room with his body locked in a tight embrace with a skeleton. The woman was nothing more than a ghost, a seductress.\n\nI wonder if we are all chasing a ghost.\n\n \n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 28th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Dr-Baqar-Hasnain1649437948-0/Dr-Baqar-Hasnain1649437948-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Sanity should prevail", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2367958/sanity-should-prevail", "date_published": "Tue, 26 Jul 22 19:41:28 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe conducts of our political leaders, betraying lack of sense of responsibility and going at any length to stay in power, provide a living example of why nations fail. Not that Pakistan has a history of clean politics but the present crisis especially in Punjab is extremely serious and is taking place when global and regional conditions are pitched against us.\n\nMore consequential is the fact that the country’s economy is in dire straits and the government is desperately seeking IMF and friendly countries to bail it out. Instead of focusing on the best use of scarce resources to satisfy the needs of the people, mismanagement is making matters worse. History seems to be repeating itself as both PTI and the PML-N-led coalition are seeking the support of the army leadership and putting pressure on the judiciary to tilt verdicts in their favour. Whatever tactics the government may employ to stay in power in Punjab and at the Center will only add to the misery of the silent majority, and strengthen the army’s leverage.\n\nImran Khan’s deliberate policy of ignoring democratic institutions and shunning the opposition defies the basic concept of pluralism and tends toward dictatorial instincts. When the entire political energy is geared towards demolishing the opponent instead of presenting oneself as a better candidate or party through performance, the political scenario can turn ugly very quickly. And this situation we are already witnessing. Besides, the prevalent policy of all political parties of blocking programs and initiatives that the previous government had initiated irrespective of country needs has to cease. By such inimical responses the worst affected are the ordinary people. It is unfortunate that the ruling party and the opposition are weakening the political structure and pursuing policies that undermine the economy and lower the image of the country. Moreover, such elite and party polarisation has filtered down at the grass-root level.\n\nIn all the main political parties — PML-N, PTI and PPP — there is excessive concentration of power in the top leadership that is preventing the advantage of making and implementing better policies that would have emerged otherwise from valuable input from the higher tier leadership where sufficient talent and experience resides. Unless political parties do not internally democratise, there is scant hope of improving the quality of democracy at the national, provincial and local levels. Moreover, when political parties have a mix of conservative and liberal, educated and experienced in sufficient numbers, politics of compromise and a certain level of decorum prevails. That seems a long way off and our present challenge is how to reduce the animosity and bitter rivalry among political parties. The flow of dirty money to influence political behaviour has become common place and politicians, instead of enacting laws and taking disciplinary action against the violators, are frequently promoting it. Checks and balances are already in our system but these are largely ignored. We have to work towards the goal to revive these, but to expect that our politicians in their present state of mind would be thinking along these lines would be day-dreaming. Can we also afford to give up and let the country continue to slide?\n\nAdding to our national woes is the adverse international environment. The Russia-US confrontation over Ukraine requires deft handling of foreign relations and the economy in which a better understanding and cooperation of major political parties is necessary. Due to accelerating global inflation and scarcity of basic essentials, especially of fuel, agricultural and industrial products, not only are the prices rapidly increasing but they are frequently becoming scarce. Unfortunately, there is hardly any realisation of these developments that is reflected in the political behaviour.\n\nThe US-China rivalry has also stepped up as President Biden has taken an aggressive posture toward China to dampen its fast-growing economy and influence in the coming years. Apart from its overall negative global fallout, it creates not only economic but also strategic restraints on Pakistan. It would remain a challenge for Pakistan diplomacy to steer this hostile terrain. While remaining steadfast in maintaining a strategic relationship with China, Pakistan should seek close relations with the US in terms of economy and trade. But, here too there is no serious thought being given apart from leaving it to our diplomats. Fortunately, we have highly professional and dedicated diplomats, and presently a competent Foreign Minister that is managing foreign policy astutely under trying conditions. What cannot be overlooked is that Pakistan’s foreign policy would carry weight when Pakistan is internally stable and its economy is strong.\n\nWhat is worrisome is that in this anarchic domestic situation, education, infrastructure, healthcare, and research and development are being ignored with serious consequences for the country’s future. The IT revolution and expansion of globalisation has been only partially absorbed. Leaders struggling for political survival are thinking and planning largely on a short horizon and neglecting these areas. This also has to do with the quality of the power structure and priorities that are driven by special or personal interests. Similarly, how many politicians are listening to the lone voice and warnings of Sherry Rehman on climate change and global warming. Or that of Raza Rabbani, Aitzaz Ahsan on wise political and constitutional issues. Successive government leaderships have been unwilling to open their minds to issues that are long-term, despite the reality that climate change is occurring right here largely due to human activities. There is an urgent need to give serious thought on how to respond to it and should invite interest across the political spectrum.\n\nBut despite the highly disturbing political and economic situation we are experiencing, it can all change provided some sanity among top political leadership prevails. Imran Khan has to lower his rhetoric, take serious issues to parliament and refrain from shaking the frail political structure. And the PDM coalition leadership should avoid political vendetta, take effective measures toward improving governance and lifting the economy while the clock is still ticking.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 27th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1083504-TalatMasoodNew-1460481455/1083504-TalatMasoodNew-1460481455.JPG"}, {"headline": "PM Shehbaz's son in the soup for 'incitement to violence' on Twitter", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2365432/pm-shehbazs-son-in-the-soup-for-incitement-to-violence-on-twitter", "date_published": "Sat, 09 Jul 22 11:12:07 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfter a Twitter account purportedly belonging to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's oldest son --- Suleman Sharif, urged his followers to \"toss shoes\" and \"name and shame\" a family that heckled Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal in a viral video on Friday, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf supporters heavily trolled the businessman's post and called for the account to be blocked for trying to incite violence.\n\n\n\nمیرے شیرو جہاں اس فیملی کو دیکھو۔ جوتے مارو۔ اس گنڈا گرد اور گنڈا لیڈر @ImranKhanPTI اور چورنی پیرنی نظر آئے 🦯 تیار رکھو۔ https://t.co/2srX5PMXJ9\n— Zi Suleman Sharif (@zi_suleman) July 8, 2022\n\n\nIqbal was targeted by PTI supporters as he stood in a queue waiting to place his order in a fast food joint at Bhera Interchange near Punjab's Sargodha.

In this regard, health officials in Rawalpindi were baffled to detect large number of dengue mosquito larvae at 16,000 different locations — 15,601 houses and 1,000 other localities — during indoor and outdoor surveillance campaigns. This is indeed an alarming revelation which could lead to a deadly outbreak in the near future.\n\nIt is believed that these dengue larvae have been breeding on a large scale during the ongoing monsoon season that saw many places inundated with water. Where there is stagnant water, dengue mosquitoes are bound to increase in number and become a health threat. The district has been carrying out anti-dengue campaigns but unfortunately implementation has been lacking as 99 locations were left out and fake activities were recorded in 377 locations. Officials have taken timely action by registering FIRs, sealing buildings, issuing challans and enforcing dengue SOPs but a systematic action plan must be carried out to destroy breeding grounds before these larvae mature. The ordeal also indicates the importance of draining rainwater in a timely manner. But with many provinces across Pakistan witnessing unprecedented levels of rain, dengue could very well escalate into a national health crisis. This merits attention from the very top.\n\nSurveillance campaigns must be carried out across flood affected areas to identify and destroy breeding grounds. Urban cities must issue dengue SOPs and work towards draining the remaining water left in affected localities. Abandoned buildings along with ponds, pools and other bodies of water in recreational spaces must not be left unchecked. But most importantly, the healthcare sector must be notified and well-equipped to deal with any outbreak.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 19th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg"}, {"headline": "tabiyat.pk joins forces with Hayat Kimya to add quality mother and baby products to its portfolio", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2371800/tabiyatpk-joins-forces-with-hayat-kimya-to-add-quality-mother-and-baby-products-to-its-portfolio", "date_published": "Thu, 18 Aug 22 07:22:34 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\t \n\nIt has been announced that MEDZnMORE's tabiyat.pk has signed an agreement with Hayat Kimya, the fifth largest diaper manufacturer in Pakistan.

Doctors have advised citizens to take precautions to avoid catching the disease during the current weather conditions.\n\nAccording to Ophthalmologist Dr Tahir Farooq, conjunctivitis is an eye infection that spreads rapidly from one person to another. “Generally, this infection gains momentum in the summer or rainy season. During moist weather conditions, conjunctivitis spreads very rapidly but it can be prevented by taking preventive measures,” he said.\n\nHe said that people must frequently wash hands and avoid hand-to-eye contact to keep eye infections at bay. \n\nThe doctor said that people should avoid rubbing their eyes with fingers as they contain germs and can lead to an infection. He said that people should not share towels, napkins etc as doing so can raise the risk of suffering from eye infections.\n\nNaveed Shams, a patient suffering from conjunctivitis, said that seven out of 11 persons in his house have fallen prey to conjunctivitis.\n\nPatients suffering from the disease feel severe irritation in their eyes and it becomes very difficult to open their eyes in the sunlight. “The patient's eyes become red and water starts discharging from the eyes. I have been visiting the doctor for the last three days, but I did not get any sort of relief,” he said adding that he was following the precautionary measures said by the doctor so that other members of his household would not catch the disease.\n\nAccording to the data obtained from three allied hospitals in Rawalpindi, the number of patients with conjunctivitis has increased in the rainy season as compared to normal days\n\nAs per statistics released by the three allied hospitals, 12 more patients suffering from conjunctivitis have landed in hospitals in the last 24 hours.\n\nEye disease expert Dr Mudassar said that conjunctivitis can also be caused by dust rising after the rain. He said that polluted air and excessive use of fast lighting devices were also the cause of this disease. \n\nHe said that citizens have to show responsibility to prevent the spread of conjunctivitis.

In a globalised world, the internet is no longer a luxury.\n\n“The internet is one of the greatest inventions of all time,” said blogger and influencer Nouman Younus. It has changed our lives in so many ways and is making life easier for us. “We can communicate with people from anywhere in the world, share our thoughts, get inspired by other people's ideas, learn new things and much more.”\n\n“Internet is an important service that sustains our digital age,” said Soban Khan, a first-year student of BS computer sciences. “Internet has been a source of information and communication globally. This connectivity enables people to communicate with each other across the globe.”\n\nThe internet was a large network of computers, according to Khan. It was also a network of networks, which were connected together in a web-like configuration. “The internet is made up of many other networks, each with its own purpose and function — some for hosting websites, others for government agencies and businesses, he said.\n\nAnd then there are those who use it simply to connect with other people around the world.\n\nThe internet had been used for numerous purposes, said Nouman Younus. “Students can use the internet to access information and resources, as well as communicate with other classmates, he added.\n\n“It is also used for social purposes. People use the internet to connect with others and share ideas that may not be shared offline, such as through social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter.”\n\nPeople used the internet to watch videos about the subjects they were interested in, listen to music that matches their taste, play games or read books online, said Soban Khan.\n\n“The internet has become an indispensable part of our life. It is used for entertainment, communication, education and work. It is also used for banking, shopping and healthcare as well as research.”\n\nRead more: Heavy rains, floods cause internet outages in Pakistan\n\nAccording to Nouman Younus, the internet revolutionised the way business was being done these days. “It has made it easier for people to start a business from home. If you have an idea, you do not need to wait until you get out of college or after graduating from college because there are many sites that can help you get started with your own business,\" he said, pointing out that this was the reason why we are seeing the young generation beginning to earn much earlier compared to previous generations.\n\n“It has made it easier for people to find information about a product or service,” he said.\n\n“This means that instead of having only one source of information, like magazines or newspapers – which sometimes don't cover everything – consumers now have access through various sources such as blogs and social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook,” he added.\n\n“This allows them not just to learn more about something but also give feedback on their thoughts about what should happen next and the companies could improve their products on the basis of the feedback.”\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/internet1597032111-0/internet1597032111-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "US lawmakers unveil bill to help news media negotiate with Google, Facebook", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372714/us-lawmakers-unveil-bill-to-help-news-media-negotiate-with-google-facebook", "date_published": "Tue, 23 Aug 22 08:59:39 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tA bipartisan group of US lawmakers on Monday released a revised version of a bill aimed at making it easier for news organizations to negotiate collectively with platforms like Google and Facebook.\n\nThe Journalism Competition and Preservation Act \"removes legal obstacles to news organization's ability to negotiate collectively and secure fair terms from gatekeeper platforms that regularly access news content without paying for its value,\" according to a news release from the lawmakers.\n\nThe group includes Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican Senator John Kennedy, both members of the Judiciary Committee, and House Judiciary Committee members David Cicilline, a Democrat, and Ken Buck, a Republican.\n\nA previous version of the bill, introduced in March 2021, was opposed by two technology industry trade groups that Meta Platforms' Facebook and Alphabet's  Google belong to - the Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice.\n\nThe updated bill would cover news publishers with fewer than 1,500 full-time employees and non-network news broadcasters.

Cyber-terrorists and state-sponsored hackers are the key actors in cyber-war, who not only attack websites to deface them and steal Facebook accounts, but also compromise and destroy our country's economic security.\n\nA malware agent used in a cyberattack for military, paramilitary, or intelligence purposes is usually referred to as a cyberweapon. Data theft and electronic or physical destruction are examples of cyber weapons. While a cyberweapon nearly always causes direct or indirect financial harm to the target organization, direct financial gain for the sponsor is not the primary goal of this type of agent.\n\nA cyber-army is a group of troops with advanced cyber talents who are extremely competent in information technology. Countries should use cyber-armies to maintain national cybersecurity. China is ranked first in cyber defensive power, followed by the Netherlands and France, then the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the United States leads in cyber offensive, cyber norms influence, and cyber intelligence. Teams at Cyber Command are allocated to specific adversaries — including Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China — and have worked with the intelligence community for years to get access to digital networks. Cyberweapons are stealth weapons that, like any computer code, are written in zeros and ones. They have the ability to infiltrate entire networks as well as infect individual PCs. They have the ability to block communication systems, confound enemy signals, and stop military attacks before they happen, all without the flash and bang of traditional weapons of war.\n\nAlthough cyber warfare is a new phenomenon in its current form, the notion is as old as warfare itself. Rivals used to try to physically interrupt their opponent's communication networks in the old days as well. Similarly, using all available means, well-thought-out strategies were used to gain access to information systems and develop mechanisms of misinformation in enemy ranks.\n\nHumans are becoming increasingly reliant on technology due to rapid advancements in communication tool applications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the efficacy of these technical techniques was put to the test. Even the most advanced states with cutting-edge medical facilities were crippled for months, forcing everyone from executives to administrative staff to work digitally from their homes.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of cyber threats has muddled the internal and external dimensions of national security, allowing less powerful state and non-state actors to increase their influence efforts. One of the causes that have fostered the formation of hybrid threats or made irregular warfare more appealing is the shifting nature of traditional ideas of armed conflict and war, because these may not motivate military action.\n\nDue to its great capacity to disrupt communication infrastructure, cyberwarfare is now regarded as a more appropriate tactic for offensive action against a rival. This is particularly risky because it has the potential to immobilize the target system for the duration of the disruption. Highly sensitive defense installations, such as command and control systems, missile-firing sites, air defense systems, and, more importantly, strategic decision-making mechanisms, may be included in these systems.\n\nThe race for space dominance, which began in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik-I by the then-Soviet Union and ended in 1958 with the launch of the United States' first manned space voyage, was perhaps to attain improved connectedness, integration, and networking in the decades to come. However, knowledge gained via advancements in the fields of information and space technology is now being used in a bad way to disrupt the same communication and integration.\n\nState institutions have become increasingly vulnerable as a result of the use of cyber warfare as part of a strategy to disrupt enemy lines of communication and cause harm to their prospective capabilities. Personal security, which is an important component of human security, is also vulnerable to disruptions in communication, location, and financial activities, to name a few examples. As a result, international and national organizations must establish legal procedures to ensure that cyber warfare does not violate an individual's rights or deprive him or her of his or her financial assets. \n\nCyber-warfare tools used by the military could eventually fall into the hands of hackers. According to Interpol Secretary General Jurgen Stock, in a few years, state-developed cyberweapons will be available on the darknet, a hidden area of the internet that cannot be accessed using search engines like Google.\n\n\"In the physical world, that is a significant problem—we have weapons that are used on the battlefield today and will be utilized by organized crime groups tomorrow. The same is true for digital weapons that are currently in use by the military, have been created by the military, and will be available to criminals tomorrow.\"\n\nRansomware, in which hackers lock down a company's computer systems and demand a ransom payment to regain control, is one of the most common cyberweapons. Cyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nCyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Moscow has been blamed for a number of cyberattacks that occurred before and during its military invasion of Ukraine, but it has always denied the allegations. Meanwhile, Ukraine has solicited the assistance of volunteer hackers from all around the world to aid in its defense against Russian aggression. A \"significant number\" of cyberattacks go unnoticed. \"It's not just law enforcement that demands we develop bridges between our silos, the islands of information,\" says the author. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Cybersecurity Outlook study, the number of cyberattacks worldwide more than doubled in 2021. According to the research, ransomware remains the most common sort of assault, with firms being targeted 270 times each year on average. Critical energy infrastructure and supply lines are being jeopardized by cyberattacks. \n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/top-view-unrecognizable-hacker-performing-cyberatt1659791000-0/top-view-unrecognizable-hacker-performing-cyberatt1659791000-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "Future Fest founder Arzish Azam represents Pakistan at BSV Global Blockchain Convention in Dubai", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2359364/future-fest-founder-arzish-azam-represents-pakistan-at-bsv-global-blockchain-convention-in-dubai", "date_published": "Tue, 31 May 22 15:40:56 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfter the success of Future Fest 2022 on May 13-15 in Islamaba, Arzish Azam was invited to represent Pakistan as a speaker at BSV Global Blockchain Convention at Grand Hyatt Dubai held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Saud bin Saqr al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council – Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah.\n\nFuture Fest is the largest tech conference of expo of Pakistan, attended by big web3 companies such as Binance, Epic Games, Kucoin, BitOasis and BSV.
