      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Supreme Court has declared that women accused of offences, which are otherwise held to be non-bailable under the relevant laws, are entitled to a grant of bail barring exceptional circumstances.\n\nIn a judgment authored by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, the SC noted that irrespective of the category of offence, the court was empowered to grant bail to the accused involved in offences even that fall within the prohibitory clause of subsection (1) of Section 497 of CrPC because they attract the principle that grant of bail was a rule and refusal an exception.\n\nThe bench was hearing the post-arrest bail of a woman involved in the offences punishable under Sections 395 and 412 of PPC.\n\nThe judgement said that the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC provides that the court “may direct that any person” under the age of sixteen years or any woman or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be released on bail.\n\nIt is noteworthy that for non-bailable offences, Section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) provides that the accused shall not be given bail if there are “reasonable grounds for believing” that they are “guilty of an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for ten years”.\n\nThe judgment noted that the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC provides that if a person accused of a non-bailable offence is arrested, he may be released on bail. Since the enabling expression of “may be released on bail” is used in this part, read with the basic principles of criminal justice, the grant of bail in a non-bailable offence that does not fall within the second part of Section 497(1) CrPC is said to be a rule and refusal an exception.\n\n\"The second part of Section 497(1) CrPC provides that an accused shall not be released on bail if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for ten years. This part of Section 497(1) CrPC which prohibits the grant of bail in certain offences is popularly known as the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\"\n\nHowever, the order said that the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC provides that the court may direct that any person under the age of sixteen years or any woman or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be released on bail.\n\nThe expression “such an offence” used in this proviso refers to the offence mentioned in the second part (prohibitory clause) of Section 497(1) CrPC, as for all other non-bailable offences the court is already empowered to release the accused on bail under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nThe first proviso has thus made equal the power of the court to grant bail in the offences of prohibitory clause alleged against an accused under the age of sixteen years, a woman accused and a sick or infirm accused, to its power under the first part of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\n\"This means that in cases of women, etc., as mentioned in the first proviso to Section 497(1), irrespective of the category of the offence, bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as an exception in the same manner as it is granted or refused in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.\n\nExceptions\n\nThe apex court also noted that the exceptions for refusing bail in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC are therefore also applicable to the accused who pray for bail under the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC in an offence falling within the prohibitory clause.\n\n“These exceptions are well settled by several judgements of this court. They are the likelihood of the accused: (a) to abscond to escape trial; (b) to tamper with the prosecution evidence or influence the prosecution witnesses to obstruct the course of justice; or (c) to repeat the offence keeping in view his previous criminal record, nature of the offence or the desperate manner in which he has prima facie acted in the commission of the offence.\"\n\nRegarding the case in hand, the bench noted that they do not find any material that would attract any of the above exceptions in order to refuse bail to the present petitioner.\n\n\"We are cognizant of the fact that the persons involved in the commission of offences of robbery or dacoity are usually professional criminals and there is a likelihood that they would repeat the offence if enlarged on bail. But the case of the present petitioner is distinguishable as she was working as a maid in the house of the complainant as per his own version, therefore, she does not appear to be a professional robber or dacoit and we do not find a likelihood of her repeating the offence if released on bail.\"\n\n\"The impugned order passed by the high court is, thus, not sustainable under the law and calls for interference by this Court. This petition is, therefore, converted into appeal and the same is allowed: the impugned order is set aside and the petitioner is admitted to post-arrest bail subject to her furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.\"\n\nThe court also noted that concession of bail may be cancelled by the competent court under Section 497(5) CrPC, if the petitioner misuses it in any manner, including causing a delay in the expeditious conclusion of the trial.\n\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIran has dropped its demand that the US remove its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) from a terror blacklist as part of ongoing talks to return both countries to the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, the State Department said on Monday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has stalwartly opposed lifting the IRGC’s blacklisting as part of any deal that would return the US and Iran to compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and State Department spokesman Ned Price said the demand has been removed from the latest version of the agreement the US has seen.\n\n“That's part of the reason why a deal is closer now than it was two weeks ago. But the outcome of these ongoing discussions still remains uncertain as gaps do remain,\" Price told reporters, noting the US is \"encouraged\" that the demand appears to have been rescinded.\n\nIndirect talks between Iran and the US, mediated by the EU, concluded in Vienna earlier this month with a draft of the agreement being reached after over a year of negotiations.\n\nIran has submitted its response to the European Union's draft text, and Price said the State Department is \"working as quickly as we can to put together an appropriate response\" to Iran's text.\n\n\"This is a process that we want to make sure that we undertake with the rigor, and with the attention to detail that is necessary for an issue that is as important as this one is,\" he said.\n\n\"We're working as quickly as we can, as methodically as we can, and as carefully as we can to see to it that our response is complete, it takes into account the Iranian feedback, and we'll provide that to the EU as soon as we can,\" he added.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the JCPOA in 2018, and went on to pursue what he and his administration called a \"maximum pressure campaign\" to bring Tehran back to the negotiating table to craft a more comprehensive agreement.\n\nTehran retaliated against Trump's reimposition of sweeping sanctions, and the addition of new economic penalties, by stepping back from its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA.\n\nTehan has since exceeded thresholds on the enrichment of uranium, as well as the amount it is allowed to possess, under the pact.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t",

The United States last week said it was studying Iran’s response.\n\n\"The Americans are procrastinating and there is inaction from the European sides...America and Europe need an agreement more than Iran,\" Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani told a news conference.\n\nKanaani said Tehran wanted a sustainable deal that would preserve Tehran's legitimate rights\".\n\n\"Until we agree on all issues, we cannot say that we have reached a complete agreement,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has repeatedly called on Tehran to release several Iranian-Americans held in Iran on security charges. Iran has demanded several Iranians detained on charges linked to U.S. sanctions to be freed.\n\n\"We emphasize that the exchange of prisoners with Washington is a separate issue and it has nothing to do with the process of negotiations to revive the 2015 pact,\" Kanaani said, adding that Tehran was ready to swap prisoners.\n\nIn 2018, then-President Donald Trump reneged on the deal reached before he took office, calling it too soft on Iran, and reimposed harsh U.S. sanctions, prompting Tehran to begin breaching the pact's nuclear curbs.\n\n\"We seek a good agreement which would guarantee Iran's national interests and would be long-lasting...We won't be bitten twice,\" Kanaani said.\n\nThe 2015 agreement appeared on the verge of revival in March after 11 months of indirect talks between Tehran and U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in Vienna.\n\nBut talks broke down over obstacles such as Tehran's demand that Washington provide guarantees that no U.S. president would abandon the deal as Trump did.\n\nHowever, President Joe Biden cannot provide such ironclad assurances because the deal is a political understanding rather than a legally binding treaty.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t",

Among discussion on measures to bolster development, the gathering will look at ways to help the continent tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nKishida's infection comes as Japan experiences a record resurgence in coronavirus cases through July and August, hitting businesses in the world's third-biggest economy, although deaths remain relatively low and the disruptions have been milder than in some other advanced economies.\n\nJapan's economy grew an annualised 2.2% in the second quarter, a slower-than-expected rebound from a Covid-induced slump as uncertainty remains over whether consumption can bolster a fragile recovery. \n\nThe authorities have eschewed strict lockdowns used in China and other nations throughout the pandemic, relying on broad usage of mask wearing and social distancing to curb infections.\n\n\t\t\t",

He knows the love, respect, reverence of a prophet that lives in our hearts. He knew that. So the anger I understood, but you can't justify what happened,\" the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman was quoted by the newspaper as saying.\n\nRushdie, who was born in India to a Muslim Kashmiri family, has lived with a bounty on his head, and spent nine years in hiding under British police protection.\n\nThe author sustained severe injuries in the attack, including nerve damage in his arm, wounds to his liver, and the likely loss of an eye, his agent said.

The only problem was that sometimes the … security agencies – three or four times we found out that picked someone up and immediately when we found out we would immediately have them released,” Guardian reported.\n\nSpeaking about the situation in Afghanistan, ruled by the Afghan Taliban that came to power in August last year, the PTI chief said that, “Eventually Afghan women, the Afghan people, will assert their rights. They are strong people.”\n\n“But if you push the Taliban from the outside, knowing their mindset, they will just put up defences. They just hate outside interference,” he added.\n\n\t\t\t",

Instead, it gave an outdated outlook for the second half (January-June) of FY22.\n\nTo recall, the country achieved economic growth of 6% for the second consecutive fiscal year in 2021-22.\n\nThe central bank said in its latest State of Pakistan’s Economy report that the collection of revenue in taxes to the government increased notably, but mostly due to increased imports during the first half of the previous fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. \n\nFederal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) collection of revenue in taxes increased by 32% in the first half of FY22, notwithstanding somewhat slower growth in the second quarter (Oct-Dec FY22), as economic activities improved and general price levels rose as compared to last year.\n\n“However, most of this increase stemmed from import-related taxes, on account of the broad-based increase in import volumes, international commodity prices, and PKR (Pakistani rupee) depreciation,” SBP said in the report.\n\nThe government, however, sharply cut imports in the first month (July) of the current fiscal year 2022 to $4.9 billion to avert the risk of default on international payments ahead of the resumption of IMF’s extended $7 billion loan programme in last week of the current month of August 2022.\n\nThe imports had hit a five-month high at $2.3 billion in June.\n\nFinance Minister Miftah Ismail said the other day the curb on imports would remain in place over the next three to four-month to improve the country’s capacity to make import payments and foreign debt 946,571 repayments.\n\nThe import curtailment may compromise FBR collection of revenue in taxes in the three to fourth-month of low imports in FY23.\n\nFrom the perspective of the first half of FY22, the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) exhibited broad-based expansion, exports grew buoyant alongside growth in FBR taxes and Kharif crops recorded higher production, the central bank said.\n\nHowever, amid multi-year high global commodity prices, rising inflation and current account deficit posed a challenge as the year progressed, it said.\n\n“These pressures necessitated monetary tightening amidst other regulatory measures to moderate demand.”­­\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 13th, 2022.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tSouth Africa have landed in Pakistan after nearly 14 years to face the hosts in two Tests and three T20Is and Men in Green’s new chief selector believes giving chance to uncapped players can help Babar Azam and co come out on top against the visitors.\n\nSome believe Muhammad Wasim has named the 20-man squad to please the audiences in order to become a popular chief selector, while others believe that he is the first man to give preference to domestic performers rather than the usual faces.\n\nOpeners Abdullah Shafique and Imran Butt, middle-order batsmen Kamran Ghulam, Salman Ali Agha and Saud Shakeel, spinners Nauman Ali and Sajid Khan, and fast bowlers Haris Rauf and Tabish Khan have been named in the squad for two Tests, first in Karachi and the second in Rawalpindi.\n\nHere we take a look at three players who can help Pakistan come out on top against the Proteas in the five-day format.\n\n1. Kamran Ghulam\n\nKamran Ghulam may not be a household name yet since he hasn’t represented Pakistan national team till now, but people who follow domestic cricket closely know him as the next big thing.\n\nThe right-handed batsman, in the recently concluded Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, bettered the record for most runs in a single QeA Trophy season. The record, earlier held by Saadat Ali with 1217 runs, was broken by Ghulam in the final of the tournament where he was representing Khyber-Pakhtukhwa.\n\nHowever, this is not the only thing that pushed Wasim to include the 25-year-old in the squad.\n\nGhulam boasts a first-class average of over 53 with 31 matches to his name. He has scored nine 100s and 11 fifties to amass 2,413 runs, with a highest score of 166.\n\nIf he can build on his current domestic form when playing against South Africa, the visitors will find it hard to beat Pakistan in the two-Test series.\n\n2. Tabish Khan\n\nIf you’re a pacer outside Pakistan, you’ll probably start your career in mid or late-twenties and end it after your mid-thirties. However, right-arm medium pacer Tabish Khan will start his international career at 36.\n\nSome may say he was not international material, but with 598 wickets in 137 first-class matches, there is and there never was a valid reason to keep him out of the national fray. Well, he’s not the only one who had to wait a long time to get his chance, Fawad Alam is another case study in this regard too.\n\nThere is light at the end of every tunnel and Tabish had to travel miles to find his light and he would love to grab the chance with both hands when he bowls to the South Africans in Karachi and Rawalpindi in the two Tests.\n\nJury is out on whether he will be able to live up to the hype after spending his heydays in the domestic wilderness, but if Tabish wants to question a system which gives multiple chances to a few and nearly zero to some, he will have to utilise all the experience he has gained and get his first and maybe final hurrah on the international level.\n\n3. Saud Shakeel\n\nAnother youngster, with heaps of runs behind him and a first-class average of nearly 49, Saud Shakeel will don the greens of Pakistan during the two Tests against South Africa.\n\nAt the age 25, Shakeel has 3220 runs in his books in 46 first-class outings. He also has 10 tons and 17 fifties to boast about and if this is not enough, he can bowl left-arm slow.\n\nShakeel has come to the fore through the Pakistan cricket ranks and has played for the U19 team, which may prove to be a point in his favour as he had the grooming of a cricketer from an early age.\n\nAll in all, Pakistan have played a big gamble by benching their usual suspects and giving the domestic performers a chance to shine. This move may turn new chief selector Wasim into a hero that many were waiting for, however it can backfire too.\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan are against the ropes in the three-match T20I series against New Zealand as they’ve lost the opening two games and only a win in third shortest-format game can help them gain much-needed confidence when going into the Tests.\n\nPakistan stayed rigid in their approach and played the same elevens in the first two T20Is, but with the series already lost, it is high time Pakistan try something new on the field against New Zealand.\n\nWhile the option of chasing may present itself if Pakistan win the toss third time on the trot, a few changes in the eleven can also be beneficial for the stand-in captain Shadab Khan.\n\nHere are the three players who can walk in and help Pakistan win the third T20I against New Zealand.\n\n1. Sarfaraz Ahmed\n\nIf you ask a Pakistani cricket fan why Sarfaraz Ahmed was sent into the wilderness, even after taking Pakistan to the summit of the T20I rankings, they would not mention his batting, his wicketkeeping or his captaincy, but they’d rather blame it on him being a Karachi player.\n\nWhether this theory of the Pakistan Cricket Board being biased against Karachi players is true or not, one thing everyone can agree on is that Sarfaraz brings something to the field which many other players can’t – the much-needed energy.\n\nSarfaraz was famous for his animated and chatty wicketkeeping when he was captaining Pakistan in all formats and even though some may disagree, the energy he brought with his shenanigans was contagious.\n\nHim walking to the bowler before and after every delivery, his comments when someone dropped a catch or did a great job in the fielding, all of that is missed with Muhammad Rizwan behind the stumps.\n\nWith Shadab at the helm against a New Zealand side which he is finding very difficult to outwit, an experienced former captain behind the stumps can go a long way in helping Pakistan enforce a win when everything has failed to work.\n\n2 and 3. Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa\n\nWahab Riaz is not doing what he is supposed to do in New Zealand – be the experienced leader of the young bowling pack, and this gives way to Pakistan go for the young but express pace duo of Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa.\n\nInclusion of Musa can also help Shaheen Afridi take a much-needed rest before he is asked to run in and fire on all cylinders during the upcoming Tests.\n\nAlso, if Pakistan really want to make things interesting, they can always replace Haris Rauf with Iftikhar Ahmed. Iftikhar is considered to be a big-hitter, and also can bowl four overs of off-spin. Since New Zealand are perfectly fine when dealing with pacers, a spin of strategy may work in Pakistan’s favour.\n\n4. Usman Qadir\n\nWe all saw what the legendary spinner Abdul Qadir’s son Usman Qadir got from his father – a spin bowling masterclass.\n\nShadab has been off colour in the bowling department in the first two matches, maybe because of his increased focus on batting and recently captaincy and Usman can help fill the shoes of team’s first-choice leggie.\n\nIf there’s a question of who he should replace in the side, anyone between Khushdil Shah and Abdullah Shafique can give way to Usman, as many may still now know that he has the ability to bat quite nicely in the lower order.\n\nPakistan will be concluding their shortest-format series in the third T20I against New Zealand on Tuesday and they will need something new to surprise the hosts and make them submit. However, if they play safe and don’t make any changes, they will surely lose again, with dignity yes, but they will lose.\n\t\t\t",

      "date_published": "Fri, 18 Dec 20 12:36:48 +0500",
      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThere was never a doubt that Pakistan would find it difficult to beat New Zealand at the latter’s home and the theory was proven true when the Kiwis beat Men in Green by five wickets in the first T20I of the three-match series on Friday.\n\nWith the defeat, Pakistan will have to pull up their socks for the next two T20Is if they want to salvage the series and win it.\n\nIt was also a sad day for Pakistan stand-in captain Shadab Khan who lost the very first T20I, where he stood as captain.\n\nA closer look of the first T20I shows there were a few things Pakistan could have changed or could have done to prevent the loss in the tour opener.\n\n1. No specialist openers\n\nPakistan won the toss and chose to bat first, but they missed the trick when they asked wicketkeeper-batsman Muhammad Rizwan and newcomer Abdullah Shafique to open the innings against New Zealand.\n\nUnfamiliar with the opening role, Rizwan lost his wicket due to a callous drive and a smart delivery by Jacob Duffy, while Shafique was found out in the second delivery he faced against the Kiwis. Shafique couldn’t fathom the bounce on the pitch and flighted one into the hands of mid-on fielder for an easy catch.\n\nWith the openers gone quickly, as has been the case for Pakistan since eternity, the middle-order, lacking the services of the great Babar Azam, fell like a deck of cards, thus the question of why did Pakistan go with two batsmen upfront who don’t understand the demands of the opener’s role.\n\n2. Batting failure (again)\n\nWith the openers gone, the onus fell on the middle-order to stabilise the innings, but a young Haider Ali was not up to the task. Here, once again, Pakistan did not think twice before sending him at the one-down position, where teams tend to send their best and most in-form batsman.\n\nHaider is all that and a little more, but he lacks the experience of playing at the third spot. However, the next best option to bat at number three, veteran Muhammad Hafeez, did equally bad in batting after being dismissed on the very first ball he faced.\n\nAll thanks to Shadab’s 42 off 32 and a late flurry by Faheem Ashraf, who scored 31 off 18, Pakistan were able to put up a fighting total, but if the top and upper middle-order would have added an extra 20 or 30, the match could’ve shifted in the visitors’ favour.\n\n3. The Wahab dilemma\n\nTo play him or not to play him has become one of the major questions Pakistan faces whenever they go out in the field. If Afridi’s is the pinnacle of mercurial batting, Wahab is all that in the bowling department.\n\nOne day, he would pluck the moon out of the sky for Pakistan and the next day he would turn a certain victory into a miraculous defeat. Is it just bad luck, or is it just his bad bowling at some points, no one can truly answer.\n\nThe latter happened on Friday, when Wahab gave away 45 runs in just 3.5 overs after being hit for two sixes and five fours. New Zealand batsmen were bamboozled in the middle of the innings by some top-notch bowling by Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Faheem Ashraf, but Wahab leaking away runs gave New Zealand the much-needed confidence.\n\nAnd if all that was not enough, Faheem dropped a catch off Wahab at fine leg and to add insult to injury, let the ball crawl away for a four.\n\nIt is quite evident now that people are prone to dropping catches off Wahab’s bowling at fine leg and square leg region. Everyone would remember the disastrous drop in the 2015 World Cup by Rahat Ali where Wahab had setup Shane Watson perfectly with world class short-pitched bowling.\n\nSo, do we curse the man or do we curse his luck, at least I can’t answer this dilemma.\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan contingent is currently in quarantine in New Zealand as they prepare for face the hosts in three T20Is and two Tests, and there is only one thing that is certain in the current uncertain Covid-19 time – it won’t be easy to beat the Kiwis.\n\nHere are the three main reasons why Babar Azam can return winless, in the series and in all the T20Is and Tests, from New Zealand.\n\n1. Bad morale\n\nAfter news of Pakistani players testing positive surfaced, the team must have seen a fall in their morale as, according to reports, many first team players were affected with the virus.\n\nThis could have led to drop in motivation, while a warning to send the whole squad home after some players breached the Covid-19 protocol was also not inspiring.\n\nPakistan players may be pumped up to beat New Zealand in the latter’s own yard after such humiliation, but with players in gloomy isolation, losing hope and feeling down may be the most probable outcome of the saga.\n\n2. Lack of fitness and practice\n\nEveryone knows about Pakistani’s love for food and our cricketers are just humans. With nothing much to do in hotel rooms, food might be the only entertainment they’ve had through the first half of their quarantine. Hence, a lack of practice may cause lethargy when they hit the ground.\n\nAll this may result in lack of efforts in the field and as the adage of catches win matches goes, a few slipups are a possibility too.\n\nPakistani players will have to put some extra yards in before the matches, otherwise, if they do just enough, the performances will also be just enough and New Zealand will roll over the Men in Green with ease.\n\n3. New Zealand’s form\n\nNew Zealand may not have won many global cricketing tournaments, but they are not known for their big trophy cabinet, they are known for their consistency.\n\nIf they are not the best on a given day, you can surely expect them to be at their minimum best at least. Meanwhile, their opponents Pakistan are known to be the most mercurial cricketing side in the world – “one minute down, next minute up”.\n\nIt is this consistency in New Zealand’s performance that makes them a difficult side to beat and add home advantage to that and it becomes a perfect recipe for Pakistan’s destruction in the series.\n\nAlso, they are unbeaten in the T20Is in the series against West Indies. Their form can be seen in the fact that they have scored quickly in the first two matches, setting a 239-run target in first and chasing a 180-run target in just 16 overs in the second.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistani players last played cricket during the remaining matches of the PSL5.\n\nMomentum will be on New Zealand’s side when they host Pakistan, first for T20Is and then for Tests. Babar will have to come up with a magical formula to lift the spirit of the players who will be feeling under the weather, homesick, and also out of form and practice. If the skipper can do that then he may not only go on to become a batting legend, but also a captain whose name would be written in golden words.\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhile the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden produced fireworks, Trump’s remarks in the environmental context that “India is filthy”, became a matter of heated debate within Indian media. Indian social media went berserk and its reaction also became prominent on mainstream media. Some went on to ask Trump for an apology on these remarks, which most of Sanghi trolls thought had hurt millions of common Indians.\n\nWhile any nation would react to such remarks from any leader of global stature, Trump’s remarks had a profound effect as Mr Modi has done a lot of work to develop a personal relationship with Trump through the “Howdy,Modi!” rally in the United States and “Namaste Trump” programme duringTrump’s visit to India this year.\n\nWhile we respect Indian sentiments, it may be interesting to conduct an analysis of where does India stand in terms of cleanliness and environment.\n\nAccording to IndiaSpend’sState of Global Air 2020 report,116,000 infants died in India due to air pollution in 2019 — meaning one infant died every five minutes due to air pollution. The data further reveals that 1.67 million Indians died in 2019 due to air pollution causes.\n\nAs per a World Health Organisation report, approximately 120,000 children under the age of five years die due to diarrhoea every year. This indicates that waterborne diseases are rampant in India due to contaminated water and poor sanitation.Hookworms, which can spread through open defecation, cause diarrhoea, anaemia and weight loss in women, according to the report. These problems are linked to low birth weight and slow child growth — 38% of children in India under five are stunted, according to the National Family Health Survey data.\n\nThe Indian magazine, The Wire, reported in 2017, that India, the world’s second-largest country by population, had the highest number of people (732 million) without access to toilets. The report by WaterAid, titled “Out Of Order: The State of the World’s Toilets 2017”, further stated that 355 million women and girls lacked access to a toilet. If they were to stand in a line, the queue could circle the Earth more than four times.\n\nThe problem is that Modi’sSwachh Bharat or Clean India programme built millions of toilets at avery fast pace across Indian landscape; however, these have become dilapidated and unusable,adding to the problem. Adding to that is the factor of demographics: Indian population has grown from 1,330 million in 2017 to 1,380 million in 2019, that’s an additional load of 50 million. So even if India builds one million new toilets every year it cannot match the pace of population growth.\n\nA CNet report published on September 11, 2020, states that India spent $30 billion to fix its broken sanitation. It ended up with more problems. The Swachh Bharat mission, launched in 2014, was an ambitious effort to stop open defecation. It's far from reaching that goal.Lack of enough water to use in Swachh Bharat was bound to make it a failure. Imagine a community toilet built for 500 people in a cramped city with irregular or no supply of water. Within a week, it will not only become unusable but also become a source of disease spread. A survey of open source pictures and videos of Swachh Bharat toilets in overpopulated cities indicates that this grand programme has become a virtual dustbin.\n\nIn 2019, India was also home to 21 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities, studies say, based on air-quality data. Coal usage in power generation stands at a whopping 75% and coal is notoriously bad for environment. No wonder New Delhi maintains the record of being the most polluted capital of the world for the second consecutive year. Even drinking water of the Indian capital is contaminated, The Hindu, in 2019,sarcastically remarked, “If it wasn’t enough that Delhi air is among the world’s most polluted, a new study has now shown that the city’s tap water is the most unsafe among 21 states within India.”\n\nIndian rivers have become almost toxic due to overpopulation and flow of sewage and industrial waste into rivers which hug large cities.Oceanplasticcleanup.com conducted a study of the most filthy, polluted and toxic rivers in the world called the “Dirty Dozen”, and lo and behold, India gets another honour with the Ganges as the second most polluted river in the world and Yamuna as the fifth filthiest.\n\nThe Ganges has a perennial problem of religious rituals.Gangapollution.com keeps a watch on issues related to it. One of its report highlighted the pollution in Indian rivers: many parts of the Hindu faith revolve around the Ganges River, who they believe is the form of the goddess Mother Ganga on Earth. Because of this, many people’s bodies and ashes are placed in the river. Large amounts of ashes from crematoriums along the Ganges River in Varanasi are dumped in each year. Majority of Hindus are cremated and placed in the river after being burned by Dalits along the ghats leading into their goddess’ body. These ashes are keeping the river from being clean.\n\nDead bodies are also a huge pollutant to the already dirty water, with 35,000 bodies estimated to be discarded into the river,yearly. This is huge amount of dead people to be floating in an important source of water for millions of people. Many times, international observers have pointed out to the Indian government to take effective measures for respect of human remains as pictures of human bodies floating in the Ganges River surface almost every month.\n\nOther than air pollution, poor sanitation, filthy rivers and water contamination, India stands tall in noise population as well.A LiveMintreport on noise pollution in India describes an alarming picture.\n\nThe red light at a traffic junction is the universal sign for vehicles to stop — but in India, it is also a signal to start something else: relentless honking. When noise from constant honking is added to the general cacophony in cities, it becomes noise pollution — and this pollution can be costly and dangerous too.\n\nKnops.co conducts regular surveys of noise pollution across the globe. Its 2018 report puts India in the top noise polluted countries in the world. The Worldwide Hearing Index was created some time ago by digital hearing app founders, Mimi Hearing Technologies GmbH. They analysed the hearing test results of 200,000 of their users. They combined their results with data on noise pollution from WHO and SINTEF, a Norwegian-based research organisation, and used it to plot noise pollution in 50 different cities. The top five cities with the worst noise pollution include Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nTo conclude, President Trump may have casually mentioned ‘filthy India’, referring to environmental issues without much attention to research and scientific evidence, but he has been proven right. India tops the list of the most polluted countries in the world in sanitation, water, air, hygiene and even noise.\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tToday is the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and living in a time of a global pandemic, the need to prioritise disaster risk reduction has become resounding and all too very real as almost every person and community is suffering from institutional and socio-economic lack of preparedness. \n\nPandemics are not new. Scientists and historians have been warning against a global novel virus for the past few decades. Beating their beakers and drums, trying to raise awareness among governments and businesses that this is not of a matter of if, but when. When the Ebola outbreak wreaked havoc in West Africa, the US State Department, under then president Barack Obama’s administration developed a comprehensive guide in dealing with and mitigating infectious diseases. This was of course completely thrown out by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nOn October 8, just a few days ago, Pakistan saw the clock tick to 15 years since the devastating earthquake of 2005. Pakistan bore colossal losses then. Nearly 20,000 children died while they were attending classes. In total, about 85,000 people died, another 140,000 injured and 3.5 million became homeless as 0.6 million houses were severely damaged.\n\nPakistan’s north was particularly devastated and Balakot, the epicentre, was destroyed in a matter of seconds and 15 years on is still struggling to re-build infrastructure and lives. There is hardly any significant rehabilitation or reconstruction. Rather, the funds that were allotted for Balakot’s rehabilitation have been redistributed to the Benazir Income Support Programme(BISP) and Covid-19 Emergency Fund. This speaks to how ill-prepared our DRR is, that funds for one disaster are siphoned for others.\n\nDRR is an incredibly lofty goal for a country that cannot rehabilitate its citizens from disasters that took place almost two decades ago. Pakistan is not the only country unable to learn from past mistakes and lack of preparedness. As stated above, the US, and rather most countries during the Covid-19 pandemic have proven the amnesia that collectively surrounds us when it comes to the destruction of disasters.\n\nDanish philosopherSørenKierkegaard makes a distinction between the concept of dread and fear calling attention to fear as having an object, a definable threat that we can identify. Whereas, dread is a response shrouded in unknowns, is speculative, not belonging to parameters or definitions. \n\nWe are unequivocally living in a global time of fear. We fear the coronavirus, we fear loss of jobs, lives, travel, routine, any semblance to the “old normal”. Our fear is driving conversations and changes around the “Great Reset”: how can this disaster be learned from in such a way that we build back the world, better?\n\nWhat can be changed about the status quo that protects citizens beyond economic and political interests? \n\nHow can this ‘new’normal truly be transformative and inclusive?\n\nFear’s object allows for these conversations to have actionable points and attainable goals. Fear makes having a game-plan easier. Fear divides people into groups of: ‘part of the solution’ or ‘part of the problem,’ as is evidenced by corona-shaming of non-mask wearers and political leaders who had to retract fake news and disinformation.\n\nDRR for objects of fear, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, is timely and due to its global nature, which unlike Ebola which was predominantly contained within the context of “poor” countries, Covid-19’s fear is ubiquitous and has spread to contexts that are not used to suffering —‘developing country’ailments. The politics of fear is also always at play. Who is fearful,who is bearing the brunt of the threat is always imperative. Thus, DRR for infectious diseases is at the forefront of the priority list and perhaps, rightly so.\n\nDread on the other hand, is objectless, casting anxiety far and wide without aim and thus, is much more insurmountable than fear. Many of us dread climate change in an abstract way. We hear the news of sea levels rising. We notice the irregularities of the seasons. We breathe in toxic air like it is a non-negotiable aspect of nature. We watch gut-wrenching clips of starving farmers and drowning residents. \n\nOften though these realities are not directly our own. The dread and threat of climate change is still far away, neatly tucked away somewhere in the future. This is why business-as-usual is the state of affairs when it comes to the economy, government, consumer behaviour and social order. \n\nDRR for dread does not have the same timely impact as DRR for fear.\n\nUnlike DRR for infectious diseases, DRR for climate change is failing to account for human, social and political disaster amnesia.\n\nWhen dread turns to fear, as one may have experienced during the recent floods that engulfed Karachi and other parts of the country, there is suddenly an actionable sensibility that grips citizens and governments alike. Especially when those citizens were elites and urbane. The problem solving caps come on as people are united against a common threat.\n\nHowever, as human populations have made unprecedented exponential advancements in the last three decades, the myriad of threats have also of course, multiplied. Existential threats such as Artificial Intelligence, climate change, cyber warfare, pandemics, to name a few, have caused mounting existential dread invariably leading to inertia of sorts.\n\nI guess the trillion dollar question is: how do we capture what we know about the difference between fearand dread to formulate and implement DRR that works with the psychology and sociology of communities and countries?\n\nThis year, the theme of the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction is governance which is defined as the measure by which“lives are saved, reduced numbers of disaster-affected people and reduced economic losses. Covid-19 and the climate emergency are telling us that we need a clear vision, plans and competent, empowered institutions acting on scientific evidence for the public good.”\n\nUnfortunately, we are all still enveloped in a fear-centric mode of thinking when it comes to DRR. For instance, Prime Minister Imran Khan has recently approved the construction of high-rise buildings in Islamabad. This is problematic for several reasons from a DRR and urban planning perspective.\n\nFirstly, contrary to popular opinion, high-rises are not green solutions. In fact, high-rises encourage vehicular clutter causing serious damage to both environment and humans alike, by increasing air pollution. Vertical urban sprawl wreaks havoc on air quality. \n\nSecondly, high-rise buildings are energy-intensive as glass is simply not very good at keeping excessive heat out, or desirable heat in. Even with technological advancement, the amount of power it takes to keep high-rises going poses a huge opportunity cost to greener solutions. \n\nLastly, Pakistan has many seismic zones and as many high-rises are vulnerable to earthquakes and not always structurally sound, the proliferation of high-rises in the country can pose mammoth near-future risks. Furthermore, high-rises, pose evacuation concerns. If you live or work in a high-rise apartment, you'll face a harder challenge trying to evacuate due to emergencies, such as natural disasters or fire.\n\nIt is said, “earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings do,” which begs the question why is our government taking urban planning measures that are increasing disaster risks rather than reducing them?\n\nOur Prime Minister has repeatedly said, “ghabrana nahi hai (don’t get scared)”; but, when it comes to disaster risk reduction, it would be very wise to be fearful.\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tIn order to further facilitate the public and speed up redressal of their grievances, the government plans to link up all complaint management systems of federal ministries with the Pakistan Citizen Portal. Prime Minister Imran Khan recently issued instructions in this regard. All existing 33 complaint cells of federal ministries will be connected with the centralised complaint system. The PM’s Performance Delivery Unit (PMDU) will decide the modalities in consultation with relevant institutions and devise integration plans. The PMDU has been asked to complete the process within 60 days. The idea is to avoid delays resulting from a multiplicity of complaint cells and duplication of efforts thereby undertaking the process of complaint rectification on a fast track basis. This will also save time and resources. The purpose is to put in place a universal system with many-faceted connectivity features for a comprehensive global grievance redressal mechanism.\n\nThe centralised system will help citizens avoid confusion as now a number of complaint cells are functioning causing problems to both the people and government functionaries working for redressal of public grievances. The integrated system will help eliminate the delays involved in manual processing of complaints. It will bring the whole process of receipt, processing, and removal of complaints under one window, and help citizens get information about the status of their complaints and things related to them. The PCP started functioning as part of the PMDU from October 2018. During the past two years, as many as 28 million people have registered 115,000 complaints, on average, every month, with it. According to official figures, 2.2 million complaints have been resolved with 40% confirmed satisfaction. The rural population might not be getting the facility of the online PCP because of the unavailability of internet services in villages and small towns. This needs to be rectified.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, September 25th, 2020.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistani Hindus have begun protesting against the Jodhpur incident as well as the hardships faced by members of the minority community that migrated to India in search of a better life. The false dreams that many of them have are regularly shattered by the harsh reality of India’s still-strong caste system, which rarely allows lower-caste Hindus to rise. Many of the Pakistani Hindu migrants are from those lower castes. For this, they often end up having to wait for decades to be allowed to become citizens of a country that claims to welcome all Hindus.\n\nPakistan Hindu Council Patron-In-Chief Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani made a much more explosive claim that Indian intelligence agencies have been forcing Pakistani Hindu migrants and tourists to speak against Pakistan and even killing people who refuse to do so. As evidence, Vankwani referred to the last month’s case of 11 members of a family who died under mysterious circumstances in the Indian city of Jodhpur in Rajasthan. The family had moved there years ago, motivated by those same false promises of a better life in India. Instead, they ended up being poisoned in their home.\n\nThe case itself is interesting for the secretive manner in which India has acted. The family of subsistence farmers was clearly not spies, yet India has refused to share any investigation details with Pakistan or allowed access to the survivors, even though they all were still Pakistani citizens at the time they died.\n\nVankwani implied that this was because a surviving family member had nominated the RSS and the ruling BJP in the police report. He also noted that no arrests had been made in the case which is extremely concerning.\n\nAfter decades of throwing accusations about the treatment of Hindus in neighbouring Muslim countries, India has shown that it is just as dangerous. We would think that now, at least New Delhi would try to show that it takes justice for dead migrants seriously.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, September 25th, 2020.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tCalls for reforming the political financing system, including oversight, have been growing ever since the Election Commission of Pakistan’s probe findings regarding the PTI’s foreign funding case have become public. However, while many of the more prominent voices making those calls may appear to have a direct stake in the game — such as the PTI’s political rivals — the truth is that rumours have surrounded the finances of most other major political parties as well. Contrast that with political activists and others who have been calling for reforms for decades, yet have been largely ignored by the powers that be. \n\nClean elections and good governance should not be partisan issues. Unfortunately, failure to update election and political financing laws, or even enforce existing ones, is a collective failure of the political parties and the bureaucracy because it deprives citizens of their basic rights, while also ensuring that truly independent candidates from middle-class or poor backgrounds just can’t compete with the big guns. But maybe that is the point — securing the positions of the ruling elite while also ensuring that they stay in line. \n\nOver the weekend, open government and election transparency advocates at the Free and Fair Election Network , or Fafen, also brought up how political parties inside and outside the parliament need to strengthen regulations to limit the ability of big spenders to virtually buy elections, warning that free-spending without consequences deprives citizens of the right to contest elections and skews results towards big spenders, regardless of whether they are backed by billionaires or smaller, individual donors. \n\nThe weaknesses in the system begin with the current iteration of the law governing elections — the Elections Act of 2017. The act is astoundingly weak in its grants of regulatory power, and can be directly blamed — along with its authors — for allowing the 2018 general election to turn into the biggest spending polling cycles in the country’s history, even when inflation is taken into account. Bye-elections and local bodies polls conducted since then have also seen unprecedented spending, effectively consolidating power among the ultra-rich, whether directly as candidates or through the political parties they bankroll. Strongly enforced spending caps can be problematic in bigger constituencies and areas with higher advertising costs, but they are still probably the easiest place to start. \n\nDonor transparency is another area which needs to be investigated. This could be done through a public database which parties and candidates must regularly update with every political donation received and details of how funds are spent. The same would also apply to private groups and individuals financing political campaigns. Criminal penalties, as long as they are fairly applied, would be more than enough to change the face of Pakistani electioneering, certainly making it cleaner and, hopefully, a little more representative.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 11th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe only thing seesawing faster than the Pakistani rupee right now is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s political capital. So, here’s a contrarian take on what’s happening to the Pakistani economy. The real crisis is one of confidence, and not just economic fundamentals. Consider this: Pakistan faced a similar economic crisis at the beginning of PTI’s term and then again at the beginning of Covid-19. In both cases, stability and economic growth were restored. In fact, unlike most countries where public debt rose significantly during Covid-19, we were able to reduce our public debt-to-GDP ratio by about five percentage points through Covid-19. So, why does this economic crisis feel like the end of the world?\n\nThe underlying crisis of confidence this time is rooted in politics versus economics. Let’s unpack the previous economic crisis Pakistan overcame to contextualise this one better. To simplify, PTI’s core challenge in 2018 was inheriting an unsustainable current account deficit with the country standing on the brink of dollar default, while PML-N’s core challenge was to reverse fuel subsidies. The first two years of PTI’s government were hard for our economy because PML-N gave an ailing economy to Asad Umar. \n\nThe primary challenge was a current account deficit of $20 billion thanks to Dar’s fixation on keeping the rupee artificially overvalued versus the dollar. An artificially high rupee meant it was cheaper to import things than to produce them in Pakistan or export goods. Hence, our industry hollowed out, exports declined during PML-N’s tenure and imports we couldn’t afford thrived, bringing us to the verge of bankruptcy when PTI took over. \n\nPTI took politically unpopular but wise decisions to correct these sins, including the painful devaluation of the currency. The idea was they would rescue the economy first, then stabilise and then put it on the growth path. Halfway through stabilisation, Covid-19 hit. Despite Covid-19 though, Pakistan clocked in growth at over 5% over the last two years. This was so good that PML-N argued last year that the numbers had been fudged by the PTI government, only to validate growth numbers this year after over-throwing the PTI government. PML-N even used these healthy growth numbers to secure the latest IMF deal. \n\nHowever, when the PML-N was strategising to overthrow PTI through a vote of no confidence, their primary argument was that PTI was mismanaging the economy and a competent team was needed to restore order. Four months later, we are experiencing the fruits of labour from team competence, with the rupee nosediving and inflation skyrocketing. \n\nIn a provocative recent column, former State Bank Governor, Raza Baqir asks why this crisis feels more dramatic when the economic fundamentals are actually better than before: ‘Given that we successfully restored stability and growth in the recent two challenging crises, why is there not a shared sense of calm confidence that we should be able to do the same this time round? This question is particularly relevant because our reserves and public debt are better today than they were in the 2019 balance-of-payments crisis before the start of the IMF programme. At end-June 2019, our gross reserves had dipped to around $7bn; at end-June 2022 they were around $10bn.’\n\nHe goes on to argue about the central role politics is playing in this crisis. And the next logical question to ask is what is the core driver of the political instability in the country today? The answer to that question is simple, the vote of no confidence against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The irony is that while PDM brought a no-confidence motion against Imran Khan, it’s the Pakistani economy that’s expressing no confidence in the PDM government today. If there’s one lesson everyone can learn from this train wreck, it’s that civilian Prime Ministers should be allowed to complete their five-year terms for both political and economic stability.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 7th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAfghanistan has a long history of destruction and suffering, be it man-inflicted or natural. Since the Russian invasion in December 1979, Afghanistan has become a battleground of world superpowers and is surrounded by an unending wave of destruction.\n\nAfter the foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan, Pakistan hosted an exclusive Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference to discuss the Afghanistan issue. The conference focused on the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and exploring new avenues to address the rapidly worsening humanitarian situation in terms of food shortage and potential economic collapse. Foreign ministers of member countries, special invitees from the United Nations (UN), international financial institutions, and non-member states, including the US, UK, European Union, and Russia attended the session. Afghanistan’s delegation was headed by the acting foreign minister.\n\nPakistan’s initiative to host the 17th session of the emergency meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the OIC demonstrated Pakistan’s strong will to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan. All member countries unanimously agreed that peace and stability in the region can only be achieved by forming a broad-based and inclusive government that is representative of the entire Afghan society. \n\nDecades of conflict and instability in Afghanistan have left millions of people on the brink of starvation. Some 24 million Afghans were already in need of humanitarian assistance because of the economic crisis and lack of development aid. The situation was further exacerbated after the recent earthquake in Paktia and Khost, which left nearly 1,500 dead and many more injured. \n\nFollowing the earthquake, the Afghan government appealed for international support to address the crisis. The Pakistani government responded immediately by dispatching consignments of relief goods. On 22nd June, the first convoy of 8 trucks carrying tents, tarpaulin, and blankets from the National Disaster Management Authority reached Afghanistan. On 24th June, another consignment of relief assistance was sent through aircraft. Besides this, Pak-Afghan Cooperation Forum (PACF) also sent 5 trucks carrying 37.5 tons of food, winter bedding, tents, tarpaulins, and clothes. \n\nEarlier, PACF had also organised free eye camps in the hospitals in Kabul and Khost where thousands of Afghan patients were provided free treatment by Pakistani doctors. The forum also facilitated the first batch of Afghan children with congenital diseases who will receive free medical treatment in Pakistan. \n\nTo promote bilateral trade with Afghanistan, the Pakistani government decided to relax the visa policy to ensure long-term and sustainable trade between the two countries. Under the new policy, six months of multiple entry visas will be issued to transporters from Afghanistan. Pakistan has also decided to import coal from Afghanistan, which can help Pakistan generate cheaper electricity and save nearly $2.3 billion. \n\nSince August 2021, the economic crisis and collapse of the banking sector have made it extremely challenging to get money into Afghanistan. International humanitarian organisations and the UN have scaled up assistance to address rising needs, but aid cannot replace the services of the state. To institutionalise financial support, a trust fund was established at the OIC conference. However, the international community remains reluctant to allow cash inflow.\n\nDuring this difficult time, the international community must lift sanctions and release Afghan funds as the country has descended into a serious economic crisis. The international community must realise that this is not the time to settle scores or debate on issues of legitimacy or recognition. They must resume aid and support the Afghan people to mitigate their miseries. \n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 6th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tOver the years, Bangladesh has experienced significant economic transformation, which can be attributed to its leadership. Recently, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the Padma Bridge and declared it a ‘symbol of pride and capacity’. As early as 1992, Sheikh Hasina was involved in the economic issues and plans for Bangladesh. She undertook the task of balancing economic policies with political implications. Sheikh Hasina shifted focus from her father’s socialist agenda toward market-based capitalist growth. She learnt from other Asian countries whose economic success was based upon four pillars: political stability, social development, trade liberalisation with export-led growth and fiscal restraint.\n\nDuring a conference, when an economist began informing her about the benefits of trade liberalisation, Sheikh Hasina quipped, “you don’t have to convince me about trade liberalisation. When I was living with my physicist husband in the Italian city of Trieste on the Yugoslavian border, I watched the border being opened three times a week and people travelling across from both sides, purchasing goods and return.” This demonstrates that Sheikh Hasina was assiduously focused on economics rather than other considerations that politicians are attracted to. \n\nEven though between 1971 to 2009, Bangladesh had hiccups in accountability campaigns and military rule, since 2009, the army has taken the back seat. Bangladesh has seen less frequent derailment of civilian governments and experienced little legitimisation and delegitimization of governments. Although its democratic history is not untainted, Bangladesh’s government has largely avoided public criticism about corruption and inefficiency. Despite having little experience in governance, the Prime Minister possessed visionary acuity and conviction that economic progress was the only way to alleviate poverty in the country. \n\nAlthough marred by allegations of coercion of opponents, after over fifteen years of sustained growth, Bangladesh has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Back in 1970, the country was 75% poorer compared to Pakistan but now it is 45% richer. In 1970, it had 10 million more mouths to feed but now its population is 170 million compared to Pakistan’s 230 million. In 2021, Bangladesh’s exports were $47 billion while Pakistan’s exports were $28 billion. The income per capita in Bangladesh is $2,227 compared to Pakistan’s $1,543. In 2022, its gross domestic product (GDP) is $411 billion compared to the $347 billion in Pakistan. The annual inflation rate is 6% compared to Pakistan’s previous 12-15%, which has now risen to 21% and is expected to further increase. Also, the Bangladeshi taka is much stronger compared to the Pakistani rupee. Importantly, Bangladesh has a strong literacy rate with high female participation in the economy.\n\nIn Pakistan, political parties have remained interested in personal gains. The repeated manipulation of the democratic process has stymied the growth of strong, democratic, and non-dynastic parties. It is worth recognising that economic growth is closely tied with political stability, rule of law, strong civilian institutions, and participatory democracy. Pakistan inherited an overdeveloped state with a feeble bourgeoise linked in a patron-client relationship with a powerful state. The country has inevitably witnessed an economic and political evolution marked by privilege and patronage. Agriculture and business incomes are primarily excluded from the tax net. There is an absence of progressive wealth tax and huge industrial and estate complexes are exempt from any levies. Our parliament is dominated by landlords, it is a small wonder that agriculture income tax has been relegated as an inconsequential subject to the provincial domain. Consequently, the tax net remains small as agriculture and industrial sectors are undertaxed.\n\nSince 1958, all experiments with the government have augmented feudal power instead of empowering the masses. The growth path pursued in Pakistan has been skewed in favour of the privileged, rich, and elite who must now make their fair contribution to the state. \n\nFollowing Bangladesh’s example, Pakistani leadership must pursue economic growth as the national agenda and adopt constitutionalism along with regional peace. Without compromising viable defence, adequate resources must be released for social and economic development. Considering that regional avenues of growth necessitate trade liberalisation, foreign trade agreements must be formed with India, Iran, China, Afghanistan, and other trading partners. Also, the export-led growth model should refocus on high-value-added goods.\n\nPakistan enjoys a comparative advantage in cheaper labour, which must be transformed to improve skills and productivity. Education and technical training for women must be promoted and adopted widely to increase women’s participation in the workforce. Also, a safe and legally conducive environment is crucial for foreign investments. \n\nA serious effort is required to levy a fair tax on agricultural incomes and the rich industrial cartels must make their due contribution to national wealth. Besides wealth and death taxes, large corporate and estate sectors need to be brought into the tax net.\n\nPakistan’s leadership can learn many lessons from Bangladesh’s experience, but the main takeaway should be that Sheikh Hasina prioritised economic growth, which is crucial for both defence and democracy.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 2nd, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces\n\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhen Imran Khan first came to power, he repeatedly lamented the insufficient political space to pursue his promised agenda. PTI was new to governance and struggled to find direction. This found comparisons with other governance models mostly bordering on unchecked power and singular control. The closest we come to it in a democracy is the presidential form but it sits against the ethos of a parliamentary governance model — more popularly accepted given our peculiar political environment. Legislation and parliamentary support for substantial reform stood unattended and PTI’s agenda remained undelivered. That was the moment to return to the electorate for a new mandate through a snap, mid-term or early election. He dithered and stalled till the chips fell. And then it was too late.\n\nToday the nation and the state is at a cross-road and most paths lead out to further disaster than seen in the last six months. It may be politics to those engaged in it but it spells life and death for a nation. There hasn’t been a more precarious moment in our national history. Politics, so used to arbitration, isn’t finding one at the moment — so controversial have the traditional points of mediation turned. The army and its leadership was maligned at will for the most part of the last six years. Any insinuation of the army’s leadership amounts to deliberate subversion, sedition and disruption in the military order. It is now a daily fodder. That the military politicised itself so much as to be a fair game is something for it to ponder over and deal with; but in a country where institutions have had to lend a hand in governance, their need to arbitrate when politicians feud will never go away. With such malicious and vicious attacks on it, the military has been literally neutralised.\n\nMaking courts controversial is the next ploy. The focus is on subverting the judiciary in public non-cooperation to contrive decisions of a side’s liking. A political system’s inability to resolve its own predicaments means that courts are asked to arbitrate. They are then framed for activism and judicial coups in public narrative when decisions don’t go their way. This is patent blackmail. In an environment where the economy is on the verge of crashing, if not already crashed, the threat of a default looms, 120 million people of Punjab have been without a functioning government for the last four months at the hands of political shenanigan-ism, the military is fighting a rear-guard action against terrorism in its midst, and the international environment is tenuous, fragile and laden against us politically and economically, governance is a non-functioning entity while politics is at best fratricidal and predatory. Those responsible for each of these, fiddle instead in crass opportunistic entanglement. There isn’t an institution left that has not been tarnished. So complete is the insinuation and slander. The crisis meanwhile only deepens and engorges us from all sides.\n\nThere are four possible ways-out from the current predicament:\n\n1) There can be a reset of the entire thing as has been the traditional resort when the army intervened and installed a transitional government after it had stalled into inaction. It has always left serious negative consequences to politics and governance in the country and skewed the balance of power unfairly. In the army itself the effects are substantively adverse and distasteful to its own professional culture. It is best avoided.\n\n2) The courts may declare a state of mis-governance in the country and an absence of a government that strictly conforms to the legal, constitutional and moral mandate to claim power. It may then emplace a national government composed of both political and non-political technocrats to fill-in for a period of 6 months to a year to reform and reset what has become broken in the normal course of things resulting in political stagnation. Historically, political classes have manipulated constitutional and legal statutes in their favour. Politics has also tended to corrupt the judicial system through inducement or fear of retribution or manipulation through parliamentary power to proverbially cut the wings of what is perceived a largely independent judiciary — a sine qua non in a democratic state. This option may seem appealing given our state of disorder and institutional break-down, though political parties for the most part will play spoilers to this arrangement by disassociating and disowning the reform process. Arbitrating structures must find a way to engage with political structures to make them a willing part of the process. A constitutional protection will be needed to safeguard any statutory recourse for making governance more sustainable and consistent.\n\n3) The third option is the Sri Lankan way. When the control of the government and its capacity to govern melted away, the only remaining power was that of the people on the streets. Law enforcement agencies could only do so much in the initial stages of the uprising but as soon as it got bigger and voluminous, law enforcement drew back to avoid bloodshed against its own citizens. The option engenders anarchy and chaos, and fragments a nation’s and a society’s core ethos as well as its physical and structural pillars. A nation may then dissolve and a state may cease to exist. In a nuclear-capable nation, it remains unthinkable and will invite intervention, even external. Although Imran Khan has waved this bogey often in a hope to elicit institutional support in favour of his political objectives, it remains a red-flag event needing constant monitoring. Khan has been very poorly and insidiously advised to use this option as a ploy. We have enough political and moral acumen in the country to save us from such a disastrous consequence.\n\n4) Our polity, so used to external arbitration, perhaps needs it the most in current times. It stands dysfunctional and polarised to the point of rupture. Seemingly there exists little possibility for political players to come together in consensus on critical issues. Such is the intensity and depth of the divide. Yet it remains the only saviour out of our debilitating predicament. The President, the army, and the judiciary will need to come together at this precarious moment beyond their respective constitutional domains to avoid a multi-sectoral meltdown of the state and the nation. The agreed mechanism in the 1973 constitution continues to be either subverted or manipulated for political favour, forcing resort to the judiciary for adjudication. Necessary tweaking of laws and statutes may be needed in a consensus to enable sustainable, resilient, transparent and effective governance both at the center and in the provinces. Early elections and a new mandate are essential for a credible government to carry an effective voice with multilateral and bilateral partners.\n\nA half derelict non-concern for a free-falling economy by the government seems more a ploy to keep the powers-that-be interested in rushing the props to keep the government in place. Such purposed neglect is insidious and needs immediate redressal. We cannot sit idly by as negative politics unravels the order. A stitch in time will save us some more.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 29th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan have withdrawn from the world's biggest international chess tournament in protest at hosts India holding a torch relay for the event through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Thursday.\n\nThe 44th Chess Olympiad will see over 1,700 players from 188 nations compete in Chennai from now until August 10.\n\nThe last two competitions were played virtually because of the pandemic.\n\nThe Kashmir dispute has weathered decades of violence and upheaval since it was partitioned between India and Pakistan when both countries became independent in 1947.\n\nThe neighbours both claim it in full and have fought two of their three wars over control of the territory.\n\n\"By passing the torch relay through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir... India has committed a travesty that the international community cannot accept under any circumstances,\" the Foreign Office said in a statement.\n\nIt said the matter would also be raised with the International Chess Federation and condemned the \"mischievous attempt to mix politics with sports\".\n\nRead: Slim chance of Bilawal, Jaishankar handshake\n\nThe Foreign Office said, \"Regrettably, India has chosen to politicise the prestigious international sporting event by passing the torch relay of this event through Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\" The torch relay passed through Srinagar on June 21.\n\nIt said by passing the torch relay through IIOJK, in utter disregard of the globally acknowledged \"disputed\" status of the territory, India had committed a travesty that the international community cannot accept under any circumstances.\n\n\"India must know that by such provocative and indefensible actions, it can neither seek nor claim international legitimacy for its unjustifiable, illegal and tyrannical occupation of IIOJK continuing for over seven decades,\" it said.\n\nThe Foreign Office said, \"Pakistan also strongly urges the international community to call upon India to end its gross and systematic violations of human rights in IIOJK, revoke its illegal and unilateral actions of August 5, 2019, and free all political prisoners including the true Kashmiri leaders.\"\n\nJammu and Kashmir is an internationally recognised \"disputed\" territory between Pakistan and India. IIOJK has been under forcible and illegal occupation of India since 1947 and this dispute has remained on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council for more than seven decades.\n\nIndia is responsible for widespread atrocities and egregious human rights violations in IIOJK. Since India's illegal and unilateral actions of August 5, 2019, Indian occupation forces have extra-judicially killed more than 650 innocent Kashmiris. More ominously, India has been seeking to change the demographic structure of the occupied territory in flagrant violation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions, international law, and the 4th Geneva Convention.\n\nA spokesman for India's External Affairs Ministry called the decision \"surprising\" and in turn accused Pakistan of politicising the event.\n\n\"I was told the team was already here,\" Arindam Bagchi said.\n\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAs a country, we are teetering on the precipice of economic, political, and social disaster. And yet, the military-industrial complex continues to thrive, elite capture remains elusive, and the juggernaut of divisive politics continues to cause fissures in our cultural zeitgeist. A colossal amount of black money — Pakistan’s illegitimate parallel economy — remains unseen, unreported and untaxed. Whether we are a police officer or a judge, a petty officer or a general, a building contractor or a factory owner, we continue to lie, cheat and defraud others and our country on our way to achieving our goals. Our economy and our morality both are on the cusp of default. As a society, we cannot stoop lower.\n\nIf there is one trait that defines political leadership like none other, it is narcissism. In our frenzied political landscape, knocking at the door of the Supreme Court has become an obsessive-compulsive ritual. If our politicians don’t get what they want, they are quick to approach the highest bench. Regardless of which party they belong to, if the judges rule in their favour, they are hailed as honest and impartial; if the judgements go against them, the same judges are deemed as partial and biased.\n\nOn July 22, a letter was waved once again, this time in the chamber of the Punjab Assembly. This time, it was the Hamza-Elahi face-off. We were back to watching television news shows where uncouth tirades were interrupted by even more uncouth tirades hurled by so-called political pundits. But here is the gist of the problem: legal discussions on the constitutionality of a matter are enlightening, they’re a thing of beauty; but when polluted by partisanship, these same discussions lose their intellectual value.\n\nWhy are politicians so obsessed with hanging on to power? The answer lies in the question itself: power. And this brings me to the power paradox which simply means that we act with empathy and modesty at first but quickly turn to coercion, manipulation and exploitation as soon as we acquire power. Whether we are corporate executives or CEOs, monarchs or political leaders, or even patriarchs in a patriarchal society, the power paradox applies to all of us. Inherent within us is a proclivity for pathological addiction to power, vanity and self-importance.\n\nIs greed a precursor to the power paradox? Is greed the driving force for success? Gordon Grekko, a character played by Michael Douglas in the movie Wall Street, puts it bluntly when he says, “the point is ladies and gentlemen that greed is, for lack of a better word, good.” The fact remains that we are rats in a rat race. Greed feeds our egos. Greed also divides us between the haves and the have-nots, between the exploiters and the exploited. Karl Marx was prophetic about our fate under capitalism: “Money is the universal, self-constituted value of all things. It has therefore robbed the whole world, human as well as natural, of its own values.”\n\nOut of hope or despair, we follow political leaders only to be ushered to the innermost circle of hell. On the one hand, we have political clans that remind us of the Sicilian mafia, the Cosa Nostra. On the other hand, we have a self-aggrandising braggart who shares a passing resemblance with Mussolini. We gather in thousands and listen to them deliver inspiring speeches just like Hitler did about a hundred years ago or Donald Trump more recently. They promise to save our country, to restore our lost glory, our greatness and excellence, while they make secret deals behind closed doors in the dead of the night.\n\nIn Botan Doro, a chilling ghost story, a handsome Japanese samurai falls in love with a beautiful girl carrying a lantern who visits his town every night but disappears before dawn. Smitten with her charm, he chases her down. They begin to spend the nights together. One early morning, the samurai’s nosy neighbour sneaks into his house and finds him dead in his room with his body locked in a tight embrace with a skeleton. The woman was nothing more than a ghost, a seductress.\n\nI wonder if we are all chasing a ghost.\n\n \n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 28th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tThe conducts of our political leaders, betraying lack of sense of responsibility and going at any length to stay in power, provide a living example of why nations fail. Not that Pakistan has a history of clean politics but the present crisis especially in Punjab is extremely serious and is taking place when global and regional conditions are pitched against us.\n\nMore consequential is the fact that the country’s economy is in dire straits and the government is desperately seeking IMF and friendly countries to bail it out. Instead of focusing on the best use of scarce resources to satisfy the needs of the people, mismanagement is making matters worse. History seems to be repeating itself as both PTI and the PML-N-led coalition are seeking the support of the army leadership and putting pressure on the judiciary to tilt verdicts in their favour. Whatever tactics the government may employ to stay in power in Punjab and at the Center will only add to the misery of the silent majority, and strengthen the army’s leverage.\n\nImran Khan’s deliberate policy of ignoring democratic institutions and shunning the opposition defies the basic concept of pluralism and tends toward dictatorial instincts. When the entire political energy is geared towards demolishing the opponent instead of presenting oneself as a better candidate or party through performance, the political scenario can turn ugly very quickly. And this situation we are already witnessing. Besides, the prevalent policy of all political parties of blocking programs and initiatives that the previous government had initiated irrespective of country needs has to cease. By such inimical responses the worst affected are the ordinary people. It is unfortunate that the ruling party and the opposition are weakening the political structure and pursuing policies that undermine the economy and lower the image of the country. Moreover, such elite and party polarisation has filtered down at the grass-root level.\n\nIn all the main political parties — PML-N, PTI and PPP — there is excessive concentration of power in the top leadership that is preventing the advantage of making and implementing better policies that would have emerged otherwise from valuable input from the higher tier leadership where sufficient talent and experience resides. Unless political parties do not internally democratise, there is scant hope of improving the quality of democracy at the national, provincial and local levels. Moreover, when political parties have a mix of conservative and liberal, educated and experienced in sufficient numbers, politics of compromise and a certain level of decorum prevails. That seems a long way off and our present challenge is how to reduce the animosity and bitter rivalry among political parties. The flow of dirty money to influence political behaviour has become common place and politicians, instead of enacting laws and taking disciplinary action against the violators, are frequently promoting it. Checks and balances are already in our system but these are largely ignored. We have to work towards the goal to revive these, but to expect that our politicians in their present state of mind would be thinking along these lines would be day-dreaming. Can we also afford to give up and let the country continue to slide?\n\nAdding to our national woes is the adverse international environment. The Russia-US confrontation over Ukraine requires deft handling of foreign relations and the economy in which a better understanding and cooperation of major political parties is necessary. Due to accelerating global inflation and scarcity of basic essentials, especially of fuel, agricultural and industrial products, not only are the prices rapidly increasing but they are frequently becoming scarce. Unfortunately, there is hardly any realisation of these developments that is reflected in the political behaviour.\n\nThe US-China rivalry has also stepped up as President Biden has taken an aggressive posture toward China to dampen its fast-growing economy and influence in the coming years. Apart from its overall negative global fallout, it creates not only economic but also strategic restraints on Pakistan. It would remain a challenge for Pakistan diplomacy to steer this hostile terrain. While remaining steadfast in maintaining a strategic relationship with China, Pakistan should seek close relations with the US in terms of economy and trade. But, here too there is no serious thought being given apart from leaving it to our diplomats. Fortunately, we have highly professional and dedicated diplomats, and presently a competent Foreign Minister that is managing foreign policy astutely under trying conditions. What cannot be overlooked is that Pakistan’s foreign policy would carry weight when Pakistan is internally stable and its economy is strong.\n\nWhat is worrisome is that in this anarchic domestic situation, education, infrastructure, healthcare, and research and development are being ignored with serious consequences for the country’s future. The IT revolution and expansion of globalisation has been only partially absorbed. Leaders struggling for political survival are thinking and planning largely on a short horizon and neglecting these areas. This also has to do with the quality of the power structure and priorities that are driven by special or personal interests. Similarly, how many politicians are listening to the lone voice and warnings of Sherry Rehman on climate change and global warming. Or that of Raza Rabbani, Aitzaz Ahsan on wise political and constitutional issues. Successive government leaderships have been unwilling to open their minds to issues that are long-term, despite the reality that climate change is occurring right here largely due to human activities. There is an urgent need to give serious thought on how to respond to it and should invite interest across the political spectrum.\n\nBut despite the highly disturbing political and economic situation we are experiencing, it can all change provided some sanity among top political leadership prevails. Imran Khan has to lower his rhetoric, take serious issues to parliament and refrain from shaking the frail political structure. And the PDM coalition leadership should avoid political vendetta, take effective measures toward improving governance and lifting the economy while the clock is still ticking.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 27th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t",

It’s not expensive and accessible to all people.”\n\nHaider said that the study also indicated that the users had mental health issues. “Methamphetamine or meth negatively affects the mental health of 70.4% of its users. Their family life is disturbed and some of them also lost their jobs.”\n\nThe report also revealed that 54.1% of users of the drug wanted to stop. “Only 17% wanted to continue it because of the efficiency they believed the drug stimulates,” he shared the findings.\n\nAlmost 35% of respondents said during the study that they were raped or sexually assaulted after its use.

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tWhile the threat of Covid-19 has temporarily dwindled, Pakistan continues to face a host of dangerous diseases that resurge annually and adversely affect the health of citizens. In this regard, health officials in Rawalpindi were baffled to detect large number of dengue mosquito larvae at 16,000 different locations — 15,601 houses and 1,000 other localities — during indoor and outdoor surveillance campaigns. This is indeed an alarming revelation which could lead to a deadly outbreak in the near future.\n\nIt is believed that these dengue larvae have been breeding on a large scale during the ongoing monsoon season that saw many places inundated with water. Where there is stagnant water, dengue mosquitoes are bound to increase in number and become a health threat. The district has been carrying out anti-dengue campaigns but unfortunately implementation has been lacking as 99 locations were left out and fake activities were recorded in 377 locations. Officials have taken timely action by registering FIRs, sealing buildings, issuing challans and enforcing dengue SOPs but a systematic action plan must be carried out to destroy breeding grounds before these larvae mature. The ordeal also indicates the importance of draining rainwater in a timely manner. But with many provinces across Pakistan witnessing unprecedented levels of rain, dengue could very well escalate into a national health crisis. This merits attention from the very top.\n\nSurveillance campaigns must be carried out across flood affected areas to identify and destroy breeding grounds. Urban cities must issue dengue SOPs and work towards draining the remaining water left in affected localities. Abandoned buildings along with ponds, pools and other bodies of water in recreational spaces must not be left unchecked. But most importantly, the healthcare sector must be notified and well-equipped to deal with any outbreak.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 19th, 2022.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\n\t\t\t",

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tMonsoon season may be attractive and pleasing, but it also brings along a plethora of health problems including eye infections. The rainy season makes a large number of people susceptible to eye infections as the moisture content in the air creates a favourable condition for bacteria, viruses and other germs to grow and multiply.\n\nAs monsoon rains continue unabated, a large number of people including women and children suffering from eye infections, allergies and conjunctivitis have started making a beeline for hospitals in Garrison City.\n\nOphthalmologists say that allergies and eye infections are a common occurrence during these rainy days as, according to them, the air gets filled with bacteria and viruses. Doctors have advised citizens to take precautions to avoid catching the disease during the current weather conditions.\n\nAccording to Ophthalmologist Dr Tahir Farooq, conjunctivitis is an eye infection that spreads rapidly from one person to another. “Generally, this infection gains momentum in the summer or rainy season. During moist weather conditions, conjunctivitis spreads very rapidly but it can be prevented by taking preventive measures,” he said.\n\nHe said that people must frequently wash hands and avoid hand-to-eye contact to keep eye infections at bay. \n\nThe doctor said that people should avoid rubbing their eyes with fingers as they contain germs and can lead to an infection. He said that people should not share towels, napkins etc as doing so can raise the risk of suffering from eye infections.\n\nNaveed Shams, a patient suffering from conjunctivitis, said that seven out of 11 persons in his house have fallen prey to conjunctivitis.\n\nPatients suffering from the disease feel severe irritation in their eyes and it becomes very difficult to open their eyes in the sunlight. “The patient's eyes become red and water starts discharging from the eyes. I have been visiting the doctor for the last three days, but I did not get any sort of relief,” he said adding that he was following the precautionary measures said by the doctor so that other members of his household would not catch the disease.\n\nAccording to the data obtained from three allied hospitals in Rawalpindi, the number of patients with conjunctivitis has increased in the rainy season as compared to normal days\n\nAs per statistics released by the three allied hospitals, 12 more patients suffering from conjunctivitis have landed in hospitals in the last 24 hours.\n\nEye disease expert Dr Mudassar said that conjunctivitis can also be caused by dust rising after the rain. He said that polluted air and excessive use of fast lighting devices were also the cause of this disease. \n\nHe said that citizens have to show responsibility to prevent the spread of conjunctivitis. He said that the water discharged from the patient's eyes is toxic and when a patient cleans it with his hands, it becomes infected and the disease could be transmitted to other people through shaking hands.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 18th, 2022.\n\n\t\t\t",

Internet services in northern and central regions have been restored.\n\n“We regret any inconvenience caused and thank you for your patience,” he added.\n\n\n\n⚠️ Confirmed: A nation-scale internet disruption has been registered in #Pakistan; the incident affects multiple providers including PTCL, Nayatel and StormFiber with real-time network data showing connectivity at 38% of ordinary levels 📉\n\n📰 Previously: https://t.co/mFBehYjlnY pic.twitter.com/YAHeV3cyNM\n— NetBlocks (@netblocks) August 22, 2022\n\n\nNonetheless, the issue, however temporary or insignificant, hit where it hurt the most: freelancing and other forms of business ventures that thrive on a high-speed and quality internet service without any disruption. In a globalised world, the internet is no longer a luxury.\n\n“The internet is one of the greatest inventions of all time,” said blogger and influencer Nouman Younus. It has changed our lives in so many ways and is making life easier for us. “We can communicate with people from anywhere in the world, share our thoughts, get inspired by other people's ideas, learn new things and much more.”\n\n“Internet is an important service that sustains our digital age,” said Soban Khan, a first-year student of BS computer sciences. “Internet has been a source of information and communication globally. This connectivity enables people to communicate with each other across the globe.”\n\nThe internet was a large network of computers, according to Khan. It was also a network of networks, which were connected together in a web-like configuration. “The internet is made up of many other networks, each with its own purpose and function — some for hosting websites, others for government agencies and businesses, he said.\n\nAnd then there are those who use it simply to connect with other people around the world.\n\nThe internet had been used for numerous purposes, said Nouman Younus. “Students can use the internet to access information and resources, as well as communicate with other classmates, he added.\n\n“It is also used for social purposes. People use the internet to connect with others and share ideas that may not be shared offline, such as through social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter.”\n\nPeople used the internet to watch videos about the subjects they were interested in, listen to music that matches their taste, play games or read books online, said Soban Khan.\n\n“The internet has become an indispensable part of our life. It is used for entertainment, communication, education and work. It is also used for banking, shopping and healthcare as well as research.”\n\nRead more: Heavy rains, floods cause internet outages in Pakistan\n\nAccording to Nouman Younus, the internet revolutionised the way business was being done these days. “It has made it easier for people to start a business from home. If you have an idea, you do not need to wait until you get out of college or after graduating from college because there are many sites that can help you get started with your own business,\" he said, pointing out that this was the reason why we are seeing the young generation beginning to earn much earlier compared to previous generations.\n\n“It has made it easier for people to find information about a product or service,” he said.\n\n“This means that instead of having only one source of information, like magazines or newspapers – which sometimes don't cover everything – consumers now have access through various sources such as blogs and social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook,” he added.\n\n“This allows them not just to learn more about something but also give feedback on their thoughts about what should happen next and the companies could improve their products on the basis of the feedback.”\n\n\t\t\t",

Musk has alleged the company defrauded him by hiding the number of fake accounts in its regulatory filings, which Musk said he used to value the company.\n\nTwitter has denied Musk's spam allegations.\n\nMusk also wanted documents and communications regarding alternative measures of active users that the company has considered and information about the use of mDAU in executive pay and annual targets.\n\nTwitter declined to comment.\n\nDorsey had supported Musk’s buyout offer for Twitter as the two men have agreed on the need for more transparency for its algorithm and allowing users more control over the content they see.\n\nDorsey has also tweeted that he believes Twitter is held back by the advertising model and Musk has said Twitter should rely more on subscription fees and services such as money transfers between users.\n\nMusk and Dorsey held discussions in March about Musk joining the Twitter board before Musk revealed he had acquired a 9.1% stake in Twitter. Musk accepted a board seat but before he began his term, he changed course and offered to buy the company.\n\nShares of Twitter were down 2.5% at $42.89 in late Monday trade.\n\n\t\t\t",

This was one of the largest Layer 7 DDoS attacks reported and Google successfully defended against it.\n\nGoogle explained that the magnanimity of the attack was equivalent to an entire day’s worth of Wikipedia visits coming in just 10 seconds. The attack was made on June 1 and peaked in about 10 minutes and was 76 per cent larger than the previously reported record.\n\nGoogle Cloud Armor protects applications (Layer 7) and websites using load-balancing techniques that keep web services running. Though Cloud Armor claims to support over a million queries per second, it managed to control a crushing burden of 46 million. It automatically detected the attack and recommended a rule to the customer to block the attacker.\n\nGoogle offers Adaptive Protection that analyzes normal traffic patterns to form a baseline to compare against.

      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tUnity Software Inc, the U.S. developer best known for software used to design video games, is in talks to spin off its China unit to help it expand in the world's biggest games market, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nSan Francisco-based Unity has sought strategic investors to join it in a business valued at over $1 billion during talks, said two of the people, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nUnity declined to comment. Its share price closed up over 5% on the news on Tuesday.\n\nThe talks come as strained Sino-U.S. relations exacerbate sensitivities over technology transfer and data handling across borders, prompting tech firms to reappraise their operations in China. At the same time, there is growing interest in expanding game-making software to new technologies such as the so-called metaverse, an immersive three-dimensional internet.\n\nUnity entered China in 2012 and its eponymous software, known as a game engine, powers many of the country's most popular games such as \"Honor of Kings\" from gaming leader Tencent Holdings Ltd and miHoYo's \"Genshin Impact\".\n\nRivals include Tencent-backed Epic Games, the U.S. developer of the increasingly popular Unreal Engine 5.\n\nUnity's spin-off plan is being driven by a desire to see its software used more extensively in China in areas as varied as smart city modelling to industrial design, as well as in the metaverse, two of the people said. Potential investors Unity has been speaking to have made big bets on the metaverse, they said.\n\nWith China tightening data handling regulations, Unity believes a spin-off would aid this expansion as it would give the unit more local ownership and autonomy over how it operates in the country, which could also increase its attraction to local government and state-owned partners, the people said.\n\nThe spin-off would be one of China's bigger technology deals this year as investment activity has slowed due to weak economic growth, COVID-19 outbreaks and regulatory tightening.\n\nUnity China Chief Executive Zhang Junbo has been working on the plan for at least a year, two of the people said. Progress has been further slowed by Unity's share price sinking 80% since its November 2021 high amid weakness in U.S. tech stocks, and by a product missing performance expectations, they said.\n\nZhang disclosed Unity's China expansion ambition last month to local tech media outlet 36Kr without mentioning a spin-off, saying Unity was exploring ways to make its technology \"safe and controllable\" within China - a reference to the government's mandate for important technology to be controlled domestically.\n\nHe also said Unity would likely hire over a thousand engineers in coming years while expanding offices in Beijing and Guangzhou in addition to its main office in Shanghai.\n\nTwo of the people said Unity's Shanghai-based employees have been asked to sign contracts with the new entity, and that talks about an operating budget separate to its parent's are ongoing.\n\nA local joint venture (JV) could help Unity \"gain a footing with sensitive industries such as governments and manufacturing that are seeking to modernise their operations with digital twins and real-time 3D enabled technologies,\" said Matthew Kanterman, director of research at Ball Metaverse Research Partners.\n\nWhile forming a China JV carries risk - a notable example being a dispute between British chipmaker Arm and its Chinese unit - Kanterman said such JVs have worked well for many Western tech firms, such as HP Inc and Nokia Oyj.\n\n\"Having the right local partners can help Unity succeed where others struggle,\" Kanterman said.\n\n\t\t\t",

That was the smallest increase since the March 2020 quarter.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders for the quarter rose 11% to $516 million.\n\nLenovo's subdued business growth coincided with the global PC industry cooling after a pandemic-fuelled sales surge, prompting several companies from chipmakers to electronics manufacturers such as Intel and Samsung to warn of a sharp slowdown in demand.\n\nGlobal shipments fell 11.1% in the past quarter from a year earlier, the largest year-over-year decline since the second quarter of 2013, according to research firm Counterpoint.\n\nLenovo’s total PC shipments fell 12.7% to 17.4 million units largely due to weak consumer demand, Counterpoint said. However, the Chinese company maintained its leadership in the global PC market with a 24.4% share. Lenovo itself did not give shipment numbers.\n\nMoreover, lockdowns in China during the quarter dealt a blow to the PC supply chain, with major laptop manufacturing partners including Quanta, Compal and Wistron suffering significant manufacturing disruptions, according to a Counterpoint report.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN IMPROVING\n\nWai Ming Wong, the chief financial officer of the company, said in an earnings call that the company's device business saw quarterly revenue decline 3% because of \"the weak consumer PC demand and the COVID-led supply constraints.\"\n\nBut he said that non-PC device businesses saw a 12% increase in revenue. Revenue from smartphone sales grew over 20% compared to the same period last year.\n\nYang Yuanqing, Lenovo's chairman and chief executive, told Reuters in an interview that he expects this year's global PC shipments to be between 300 million units and 310 million units. That would be a near 10% dip from the figure of 341 million units shipped last year reported by data firm Canalys.\n\nBut Yang said that supply-chain shortages, which plagued many hardware manufacturers earlier this year, have improved.\n\n\"In some areas, we are still facing a shortage, particularly in the data center business,\" he said, \"But generally speaking, I'm not seeing significant challenges in the second half of this year.\"\n\nHe also added that Lenovo has seen some price increases in the semiconductor industry but the company would remain flexible in dealing with price fluctuations around components.\n\nLenovo's shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange were down 0.71% while the broader Hang Seng index was down 2.32%.\n\n\t\t\t",

      "date_published": "Sat, 06 Aug 22 11:58:02 +0500",
      "details": "\n\t\t\t\tCyber-war is more concerning to today's policymakers and decision-makers than cybercrime. Cyber-terrorists and state-sponsored hackers are the key actors in cyber-war, who not only attack websites to deface them and steal Facebook accounts, but also compromise and destroy our country's economic security.\n\nA malware agent used in a cyberattack for military, paramilitary, or intelligence purposes is usually referred to as a cyberweapon. Data theft and electronic or physical destruction are examples of cyber weapons. While a cyberweapon nearly always causes direct or indirect financial harm to the target organization, direct financial gain for the sponsor is not the primary goal of this type of agent.\n\nA cyber-army is a group of troops with advanced cyber talents who are extremely competent in information technology. Countries should use cyber-armies to maintain national cybersecurity. China is ranked first in cyber defensive power, followed by the Netherlands and France, then the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the United States leads in cyber offensive, cyber norms influence, and cyber intelligence. Teams at Cyber Command are allocated to specific adversaries — including Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China — and have worked with the intelligence community for years to get access to digital networks. Cyberweapons are stealth weapons that, like any computer code, are written in zeros and ones. They have the ability to infiltrate entire networks as well as infect individual PCs. They have the ability to block communication systems, confound enemy signals, and stop military attacks before they happen, all without the flash and bang of traditional weapons of war.\n\nAlthough cyber warfare is a new phenomenon in its current form, the notion is as old as warfare itself. Rivals used to try to physically interrupt their opponent's communication networks in the old days as well. Similarly, using all available means, well-thought-out strategies were used to gain access to information systems and develop mechanisms of misinformation in enemy ranks.\n\nHumans are becoming increasingly reliant on technology due to rapid advancements in communication tool applications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the efficacy of these technical techniques was put to the test. Even the most advanced states with cutting-edge medical facilities were crippled for months, forcing everyone from executives to administrative staff to work digitally from their homes.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of cyber threats has muddled the internal and external dimensions of national security, allowing less powerful state and non-state actors to increase their influence efforts. One of the causes that have fostered the formation of hybrid threats or made irregular warfare more appealing is the shifting nature of traditional ideas of armed conflict and war, because these may not motivate military action.\n\nDue to its great capacity to disrupt communication infrastructure, cyberwarfare is now regarded as a more appropriate tactic for offensive action against a rival. This is particularly risky because it has the potential to immobilize the target system for the duration of the disruption. Highly sensitive defense installations, such as command and control systems, missile-firing sites, air defense systems, and, more importantly, strategic decision-making mechanisms, may be included in these systems.\n\nThe race for space dominance, which began in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik-I by the then-Soviet Union and ended in 1958 with the launch of the United States' first manned space voyage, was perhaps to attain improved connectedness, integration, and networking in the decades to come. However, knowledge gained via advancements in the fields of information and space technology is now being used in a bad way to disrupt the same communication and integration.\n\nState institutions have become increasingly vulnerable as a result of the use of cyber warfare as part of a strategy to disrupt enemy lines of communication and cause harm to their prospective capabilities. Personal security, which is an important component of human security, is also vulnerable to disruptions in communication, location, and financial activities, to name a few examples. As a result, international and national organizations must establish legal procedures to ensure that cyber warfare does not violate an individual's rights or deprive him or her of his or her financial assets. \n\nCyber-warfare tools used by the military could eventually fall into the hands of hackers. According to Interpol Secretary General Jurgen Stock, in a few years, state-developed cyberweapons will be available on the darknet, a hidden area of the internet that cannot be accessed using search engines like Google.\n\n\"In the physical world, that is a significant problem—we have weapons that are used on the battlefield today and will be utilized by organized crime groups tomorrow. The same is true for digital weapons that are currently in use by the military, have been created by the military, and will be available to criminals tomorrow.\"\n\nRansomware, in which hackers lock down a company's computer systems and demand a ransom payment to regain control, is one of the most common cyberweapons. Cyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nCyberwar has long been a source of fear for governments around the world, but it has resurfaced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Moscow has been blamed for a number of cyberattacks that occurred before and during its military invasion of Ukraine, but it has always denied the allegations. Meanwhile, Ukraine has solicited the assistance of volunteer hackers from all around the world to aid in its defense against Russian aggression. A \"significant number\" of cyberattacks go unnoticed. \"It's not just law enforcement that demands we develop bridges between our silos, the islands of information,\" says the author. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Cybersecurity Outlook study, the number of cyberattacks worldwide more than doubled in 2021. According to the research, ransomware remains the most common sort of assault, with firms being targeted 270 times each year on average. Critical energy infrastructure and supply lines are being jeopardized by cyberattacks. \n\n\t\t\t",

According to some statistics, from March 2021 – 2022, Pakistan alone has traded around $18.60 billion in cryptocurrency and has as many as 20 million users whereas registered investors in stock exchange is merely 220,000.\n\nArzish Azam stated in his closing remarks that since this industry has very high public demand and can help Pakistan’s economic growth, we should all figure out a way to use it for Pakistan’s benefit.\n\nThe government’s sentiment to support emerging industries was shared by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail in his keynote concluding the final session of Future Fest on 16 May called \"Roadmap to the Future\", he stated that the Government should try and stay away, let them be but not try to regulate them and certainly not try to tax them.\n\n\n\nThis session also featured a discussion between Dr Murtaza Syed – Governor (Deputy) State Bank of Pakistan; Tariq Malik – Chairman NADRA; and Imran Haleem Shaikh, COO – JS Bank, and Noman Azhar – CDO JS Bank and Head of Zindigi on how the tech industry can provide financial stability to the youth with the help of government and private sector initiatives and support.\n\n\t\t\t",

Targets included people connected to the government, military and law enforcement in Kabul, it said.\n\nFacebook said it removed SideCopy from its platform in August. The social media company, which recently changed its name to, said the group created fictitious personas of young women as \"romantic lures\" to build trust and trick targets into clicking phishing links or downloading malicious chat apps.\n\nIt also compromised legitimate websites to manipulate people into giving up their Facebook credentials. \"It's always difficult for us to speculate as to the end goal of the threat actor,\" said Facebook's head of cyber espionage investigations, Mike Dvilyanski.\n\n\"We don't know exactly who was compromised or what the end result of that was.\" Major online platforms and email providers including Facebook, Twitter Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn have said they took steps to lock down Afghan users' accounts during the Taliban's swift takeover of the country this past summer.\n\nAlso read: US blacklists Israeli hacking tool vendor NSO Group\n\nFacebook said it had not previously disclosed the hacking campaign, which it said ramped up between April and August, due to safety concerns about its employees in the country and the need for more work to investigate the network.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the cyberattack was intended \"to disrupt Ukrainian command and control during the invasion, and those actions had spillover impacts into other European countries\".\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called the satellite internet hack \"deliberate and malicious\" and the Council of the EU said it caused \"indiscriminate communication outages\" in Ukraine and several EU member states.\n\nThe Viasat outage remains the most publicly visible cyberattack carried out since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in part because the hack had immediate knock-on consequences for satellite internet users across Europe and because the crippled modems often had to be replaced manually.\n\nAlso read: Russian hackers targeted NATO, eastern European militaries: Google\n\n\"After those modems were knocked offline it wasn't like you unplug them and plug them back in and reboot and they come back,\" the US National Security Agency's Director of Cybersecurity Rob Joyce told Reuters on the sidelines of a cybersecurity conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"They were down and down hard; they had to go back to the factory to be swapped out.\"\n\nThe precise consequences of the hack on the Ukrainian battlefield have not been made public, but government contracts reviewed by Reuters show that KA-SAT has provided internet connectivity to Ukrainian military and police units.\n\nThe satellite modem sabotage caused a \"huge loss in communications in the very beginning of war\", Ukrainian cybersecurity official Victor Zhora said in March.\n\nIn a statement, Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection said that Russia \"is an aggressor country attacking Ukraine not only on our land, but in cyberspace too\".\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Russia routinely denies it carries out offensive cyber operations.\n\nAlso read: US spy agency probes sabotage of satellite internet during Russian invasion\n\nViasat said in a statement that it \"recognised\" the announcement and would continue to work with government officials to investigate the hack. The company did not provide an update on a Viasat official's comments to Reuters in late March that the hackers were still trying to interfere with the company's operations, albeit to limited effect.\n\nThe satellite modem-wrecking cyberattack remains the most visible hack of the war, but many others have taken place since and not all of them have been made public.\n\n\"That was the biggest single event,\" said Joyce. \"It certainly had new and novel tradecraft, but there have been multiple attacks.\"\n\nSpaceX billionaire Elon Musk said his company's Starlink satellite broadband service, which is available in Ukraine, had resisted Russian cyberwar jamming and hacking attempts, though adding in a post on Twitter: \"They’re ramping up their efforts\".\n\n\t\t\t",
