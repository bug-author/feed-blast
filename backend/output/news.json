Ukraine denied any involvement.\n\nRussia's TASS state news agency quoted Andrei Krasnov, someone who knew Dugina, as saying the vehicle belonged to her father and that he was probably the intended target.\n\nFather and daughter had been attending a festival outside Moscow and Dugin had decided to switch cars at the last minute, Russian government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta reported.\n\nTV footage accompanying a statement by Moscow region investigators showed officers collecting debris and fragments from the spot where the explosion happened.\n\nThe statement, which described Darya Dugina as a journalist and political expert, said investigators had opened a murder case and would be carrying out forensic examinations.\n\nInvestigators were considering \"all versions\" when it came to working out who was responsible, it said.\n\nThe head of Russia's Investigative Committee ordered the institution's central branch to take over the investigation.\n\n\"An explosive device was placed on the underside of the car on the driver's side,\" the committee said in a statement. \"Darya Dugina, who was behind the wheel, died at the scene.\n\n\"The investigation believes that the crime was planned in advance and was of a contractual nature,\" it added.\n\nMaria Zakharova, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said that if the investigation's trail led to Ukraine, then it would point to a policy of \"state terrorism\" being pursued by Kyiv.\n\nUkraine denied involvement\n\n\"I confirm that Ukraine, of course, had nothing to do with this because we are not a criminal state, like the Russian Federation, and moreover we are not a terrorist state,\" said Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, speaking on Ukrainian television.\n\nHe appeared to blame internal power struggles between \"various political factions\" in Russia for the killing, and suggested the incident was the \"Karmic\" payback for supporters of Russia's actions in Ukraine like Dugina and her father.\n\nAlexander Dugin, Darya's father, has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking and other territories in a vast new Russian empire.\n\nHe wants that empire to include Ukraine where Russian forces are currently carrying out what Moscow calls a \"special military operation\" to demilitarise Ukraine.\n\nThe influence of Dugin, who is on a US sanctions list, over Russian President Vladimir Putin has been a subject for speculation, with some Russia watchers asserting that his sway is significant and others calling it minimal.\n\nDarya Dugina, who also went by the surname Platonova and was reported by Russian state media to be 30 years old, broadly supported her father's ideas and appeared on state TV in her own right to offer support for Russia's actions in Ukraine.\n\nIn a statement in March, the US Treasury said Dugina, the chief editor of the United World International website, which has suggested Ukraine would \"perish\" if admitted to the NATO military alliance, had been put on a US sanctions list.\n\n\t\t\t",

            "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan has on Sunday firmly rejected the recent spate of 'false terrorism-related assertions' by India,\u00a0stating that\u00a0some detached reported\u00a0incidents were being\u00a0presented as a 'so-called \u2018terror\u2019 plot'.\n\nIn a statement, Foreign Office Spokesperson Asim Iftikhar said that the recent false accusations were \"nothing but [a] continuation of the sinister Indian design to yet again raise the 'terrorism'\u00a0bogey to malign Pakistan.\"\n\nIt\u00a0noted that in order to build on this orchestrated \u2018terrorism\u2019 narrative against Pakistan, a section of the Indian media reported that India had intercepted a message from a \u2018Pakistani\u2019 WhatsApp number as well as seized an \u2018empty boat\u2019 in Maharashtra along with some weapons.\n\nThe statement furthered that segments of the Indian media deceitfully sought to link these to the \"preposterous claims about a so-called \u2018Mumbai style\u2019 attack being planned.\"\n\nWhile strongly denouncing the latest Indian insinuations and allegations, Pakistan called upon\u00a0India \"not to make any mistake again\".\n\nThe statement furthered that: \u201cPakistan stands ready and resolute and is fully capable of effectively responding to any misadventure as was manifestly evident in response to India\u2019s ill-advised and irresponsible action in February 2019.\" \n\nThe FO spokesperson was alluding to\u00a0when Indian planes violated Pakistani airspace and conducted air strikes inside Pakistani territory.\n\nRead: 'Pak-US partnership to serve interests of peace, security & stability'\n\nSeparately, the Indian media also reported that the Indian intelligence and border forces were on high alert for possible \u2018cross-border infiltration\u2019 attempts along Rajauri, it added.\n\n\u201cThe mischievous Indian propaganda campaign and baseless allegations against Pakistan reflected its utter desperation emanating from its complete failure to break the will of the Kashmiri people in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK),\u201d\u00a0added the spox.\n\n\u201cThe possibility of a choreographed \u2018false flag activity\u2019 to target Pakistan and negatively affect its political and economic interests could not be ruled out, as Indian propaganda was pointing in that direction,\u201d\u00a0he asserted.\n\nThe statement maintained that: \"India must recognise that no amount of its false propaganda can deter Pakistan from exposing India\u2019s brutalisation of the Kashmiri people through an unabated military siege, indiscriminate use of force, extra-judicial killings, incarceration of Kashmiri leaders and youth, a crackdown on the media and human rights activists, and denial of access to international human rights and humanitarian organisations to IIOJK.\u201d\u00a0\n\nPakistan also urged the international community to take immediate cognizance of the fact that India was yet again resorting to classic \u2018false flag\u2019 methods to advance its sinister designs and that this could have serious implications for peace and security in the region. \n\n\"The international community must urge India to act responsibly,\" the FO said.\u00a0\n\nHe said that India should\u00a0be held accountable for its gross and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in IIOJK. \n\n\"The realisation of sustainable peace, stability and prosperity in South Asia remained contingent upon peaceful resolution of the long-standing Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people,\u201d he added.\n\n\t\t\t",

He was a thinker, philosopher, and poet, who authored several books on Islam and literature. He also knew seven languages and translated books from English and German into Urdu. He was highly respected by brilliant minds of his time like the great poet-philosopher Allama Iqbal and Rabindranath Tagore, the Bengali poet and mystic and the Nobel Laureate for Literature. \n\nDr Hakim (Khalifa Sahib) was the product of an era during which there was an awakening amongst the Muslims of the Subcontinent. Born in 1896, he lost his father at an early age but was guided by a sagacious mother who recognised his talents and encouraged him to pursue his ambitions. His education began in Lahore from where he went to MAO College, Aligarh, and finally completed his Bachelors\u2019 from St Stephen\u2019s College, Delhi. He then enrolled in its Department of Philosophy for a Masters\u2019 degree and secured record-breaking marks. \n\n\n\nDr Hakim in Heidelberg 1923 flanked by his wife Khadija, the German nanny Monica and infant son Arif Hakim\n\nIqbal and Khalifa Sahib shared Kashmiri ancestry and a close relationship. Though there was an age difference of nearly 20 years, there was a great deal of respect of each other\u2019s capabilities and commonality in their thoughts on religion, Eastern and Western philosophy, literature and poetry. When Nizam Osman Ali Khan established the Osmania University in Hyderabad in 1918, Dr Iqbal declined the offer to head its Department of Philosophy but recommended Khalifa sahib. He wrote to the Nizam, \u201cKhalifa Abdul Hakim, too, is Iqbal in his own way.\u201d Khalifa Sahib was only 22 years old when he became a founding professor in the department. \n\n\n\nThe Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah with students and dignitaries at the Amar Singh Club, Srinagar in 1946.

He first learnt German and then became a research scholar at the universities of Freiberg, Heidelberg, Sorbonne (Paris) and Cambridge. In 1925 he was awarded a Doctorate in Philosophy from Heidelberg University. Coincidently, 20 years earlier Dr Allama Iqbal also spent time at Heidelberg studying Philosophy and Literature as well as German and was so fond of the city that he wrote the poem \"Ek \u015bh\u0101m Nekar ke kin\u0101re\" (An Evening on the bank of the Neckar). Interestingly, both did their doctorates in philosophy on similar thesis: Iqbal on The Development of Metaphysics in Persia\", and Khalifa Sahib on the Metaphysics of Rumi. Allama Iqbal considered Jalal ud Din Rumi (1207-73), as his murshid or spiritual teacher. \n\nKhalifa Sahib then returned to Osmania University and at the age of 29 was appointed as the Head of the Department of Philosophy. Osmania was the seventh university to be established in India and was the first with Urdu as the medium of instruction, which the Nizam considered \"the language of the widest currency in India.\u201d To enable his students to study philosophy in Urdu, Khalifa Sahib translated two English texts: Weber\u2019s History of Philosophy, (Tareekh e Falsifa e Hayat), and Varieties of Religious Experiences by William James (Nafsiyat o Vardat e Ruhani). He also translated two texts from German: Outline of Greek Philosophy by Eduard Zeller (Mukhtasir Tareekh Falsafa e Yunan), and History of Modern Philosophy by Harold Foffding (Tareekh Falsifa e Jadeed). Khalifa Sahib also contributed several articles to the university magazine, delivered public lectures, and presided over literary functions and Mushairas (poetry recitals). Krishen Parshad, the prime minister of the state, who patronised the arts, appreciated the role of Khalifa Sahib. Mrs Sarojini Naidu, one of India's feminist luminaries, was another of his admirers. \n\n\n\nIn 1957 Dr Hakim attended the UNESCO sponsored East West Philosophers\u2019 Conference in Canberra to improve the understanding of the cultures of East and West. Dinner at the Pakistan High Commission. L-R Professor Sharif, J Oldham, former High Commissioner for Australia in Pakistan, Lt Gen Muhammad Yousuf, High Commissioner for Pakistan, Begum Yousuf, Begum Jafri, Fareed Jafri, Press Attach\u00e9, Dr Hakim\n\nRabindranath Tagore had established an open-air college at Shantiniketan in West Bengal, which became the Visva-Bharati University after Independence. The same year that Dr Hakim returned from Heidelberg, he was asked by Tagore to request the Nizam to establish an Islamic Centre at Shantineketan. He also offered Dr Khalifa to be the first to occupy the Chair of Islamic Studies. Dr Hakim arranged a grant from Hyderabad State but declined the offer of the Chair as he wanted to serve the community on a large scale. Khalifa Sahib remained with Osmania University for nearly 20 years.\n\nKhalifa Sahib wrote extensively on One World, One God, One Humanity. His role in promoting the universal values and message of progressive Islam, both nationally and internationally, was well received. He was a member of a number of international forums that promoted universal values. He was a sponsor of the Brotherhood Week, formed in 1930 to counter the anti-immigrant and anti-religious narrative across different religions in the US. It was celebrated till the 1950s and the interfaith engagement based on cross-country tours became very popular. Amongst others in this fraternity were M Raziuddin Siddiqui the nuclear physicist, G D Birla the great industrialist, Prince Dhani of Thailand, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and Sir Abdur Rashid, a legal philosopher and the first chief justice of Pakistan. Its first Honorary Chairman was President Roosevelt, followed by Konrad Adeneur, Vijayalakshmi Pandit, and others. \n\n\n\nDr. Hakim (right) at a banquet hosted by King Ibne Saud of Saudi Arabia where he was presented with a royal robe and sword in 1953. Seated on the left is Governor General of Pakistan Ghulam Muhammad, and standing behind in glasses is Muhammad Asad the Austro-Hungarian-born Jew who converted to Islam and translated the Quran into English\n\nDr Hakim was a member of various Commissions, to give practical shape to ideas reflecting liberal Islam. Khalifa Sahib represented the high ambitions of the sub-continent\u2019s educated generations. These lectures were a reminder to the present generations who may have become unmindful of their collective past and set aside the intellectual perspectives of their forebears. He brought the Muslim psyche closer to the conditions of the modern world that belonged as much to progressive Islam.\n\nIn 1943 he went on a three-year deputation to the Amar Singh College at Srinagar. He was also appointed Director of Education of the State of Kashmir. Kashmir was very close to Khalifa Sahib\u2019s heart. In June 1931, Abdul Qadeer, a Kashmiri activist was arrested and tried on charges of sedition after he made an impassioned speech against the Dogra rule to a politically charged crowd in Srinagar in June 1931. Following this event, Khalifa Sahib wrote a poem sitting beside the Dal lake in Srinagar with the title, Ai Khitta e Kashmir (O land of Kashmir). The poem captured the emotions of those struggling for freedom and is prophetic because he foresaw the struggle for freedom with the attendant sacrifices by the Kashmiris. He was highly regarded by most of the Kashmiri leaders and while posted at Srinagar, he was involved in negotiations. \n\n\n\nDuring a lecture tour in the United States in 1952, Dr. Hakim was given a tour of the Paramount Studios, Hollywood California by the famous actress Yvonne De Carlos (seated center). One of her most famous roles was as the wife of Prophet Moses in The Ten Commandments screened in 1956\n\nBoth the contending political figures in Kashmir i.e. Chaudhri Ghulam Abbas of the Muslim Conference and Shaikh Abdullah of the National Conference frequently visited his house in Srinagar. Khalifa Sahib made great efforts but was unable to draw the two closer and advised Shaikh Abdullah against launching the quit Kashmir movement in 1946. He correctly reasoned that since imperialism was coming to an end after the Second World War, such a hasty action was uncalled for. However, at the instigation of Nehru, Abdullah went ahead which led to mass agitation with 20 dead and 200 arrests. Nehru attempted to come to his rescue with a battery of lawyers but was stopped dramatically by the bayonets of the Maharaja\u2019s soldiers at the Kohala bridge over the River Jhelum. \n\nJust before Independence, Khalifa Sahib transferred all his assets from Hyderabad, Deccan to Srinagar but he was unsure that he had made the right decision. He had a strong spiritual connection with Hafiz Shirazi, the 14th century lyric poet from Persia whose monumental work Dewan-i-Hafiz is considered one of the seven literary wonders of the world by Goethe and Emerson. Khalifa Sahib used to consult Hafiz\u2019s Dewan for a faal (foretelling of events, advice, etc.) and there were times when the exact words of his query would appear in the faal! When he consulted the Dewan in early 1948, he was advised to take off and throw away his pashmina shawl because the chinaar (sycamore) trees were to go up in flames. Both the pashmina wool and the chinaar are symbolic for Kashmir, the wool in particular. He, therefore, moved to Lahore, and soon after the Kashmir War of 1948-49 broke out.\n\n\n\nDr. Hakim (fourth from right) at the Institute of Islamic Culture that he founded at 2 Club Road, Lahore\n\n\nWhen he shifted back to his home city of Lahore in 1948, the Punjab University awarded him Honorary Legum Doctrin Award (LL.D); however, he declined the post of Vice Chancellor of Punjab University. He felt he could be of greater use in contributing towards the newly established State of Pakistan based on the vision of Iqbal and Mohammad Ali Jinnah\u2019s efforts. His main interest was in the promotion of universal values in Islam in the contemporary context. These were reflected not only in his writings but also in establishing an Institute of Islamic Culture in Lahore. The institute, which still exists at 2 Club Road, published books on a variety of subjects that exemplified the progressive nature of Islam. He took great interest in this institute and remained its director till he passed away. \n\nIn 1953, the Institute published Khalifa Sahib\u2019s book on Islam and Communism. In this well-acclaimed book, he observed that while purporting to address material aspects, the Russian Revolution was detrimental to the values of humanity. He wrote that the pendulum of human existence swung between Liberty and Order to hold a balance between the two. Unrestricted liberty would not create or consolidate any social or political structure; that a stream remained a stream only if it flowed between the banks. On the other hand, too much order of thought and in the private life of the individual curtailed elbowroom for freethinking, so deadening the human spirit. All totalitarianism stems from force and denial of personal freedom with differences resolved through force. He saw Islam as providing a just balance between order and liberty where exploitation, monarchies and feudalism would give way to a welfare state of one world and one humanity. \n\n\n\nIn 1962, President Ayub and Nawab of Kalabagh visited the Institute of Islamic Culture founded by Dr. Hakim in Lahore. In the works of Dr. Hakim, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto (second from right) found what he was looking for: an author, a book, and a philosophy he could politically present as \u2018Islamic Socialism\u2019\n\n\u00a0\n\nKhalifa Sahib also presented papers at seminars of the Pakistani chapter of the Congress of Cultural Freedom, an international association formed in 1950 to counter communist influence. Worldwide it had over 100 distinguished thinkers, writers, artists, scientists and teachers from 21 countries. Khalifa Sahib\u2019s focus was on Islam in the modern world and how to transmit its values to the younger generation; that Islam did not insist on belief in any dogma without evidence or against the dictates of reason, observation and experience. He believed that knowledge and love are the ultimate values in Islam, which together constitute the good life for all times and in other worlds.\n\nIn his doctoral thesis, the Metaphysics of Rumi from Heidelberg University, he explains Rumi as a source of inspiration across cultures; Rumi does not dissect reality piecemeal rather he enters the very heart of it and communicates the living experience through which he passes. Khalifa Sahib explains Rumi being an heir to an immense intellectual and spiritual wealth through Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Greek philosophy, Christian, Islamic and Persian influences. In his incisive book Islamic Ideology, Khalifa Sahib mentions that within the fold of Islam, all great prophets were monotheists and in the line of the religious development of the Israelites, the Qur\u2019an makes a special reference to Abraham who presented monotheism in a clear and emphatic form that the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) repeatedly asserted by saying that he trod the path of truth as treaded by Abraham who repudiated idol worship and the worship of natural phenomena as gods. In Hinduism too there was a long and gradual development from polytheism and nature worship to monotheism or spiritual monism, though a large body of Hindus could not step beyond incarnation. Buddhism was monotheistic in a mystic sense through an indescribable unity with their divinity. Christian belief was also Unitarian though the trinity doctrine did not subscribe to the monotheism of Christianity. Islam never claimed to be the first teacher of monotheism; it asserts this belief is as old as humanity preached by the great prophets and scriptures in a pure form. Islam believes in the unity of all religions being its essential tenet. From which follows the unity of humanity.\n\n\n\nDr. Hakim fulfilled Alama Iqbal\u2019s express desire to translate the Bhagwat Gita into Urdu verse. The unpublished manuscript was picked up by Professor Khusro, the Vice-Chancellor of the Aligarh University during his visit to Pakistan and published by the industrialist Firodia. The relatives of Dr. Hakim were invited to the book launching in Delhi which was attended by the Prime Minister of India. Present in the picture L-R. Mr Firodia, PM Vajpayee, Dr. Rafia Hasan (daughter of Dr. Hakim), Mrs. Firodia, Professor Khusro, Pakistan\u2019s High Commissioner Jahangir Qazi and Dr. Naveed Hasan co-author of this article\n\nKhalifa Sahib too asserted that linguistic and other differences existed in the modes of life in different nations but all humanity was one and all nations should try to agree on fundamentals. This constituted the brotherhood of man. This brotherhood in early Islamic history allowed everyone to follow their own convictions provided the peaceful social order was kept intact. For example, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) issued invitations to the rulers of surrounding kingdoms not to accept Arab domination but to submit to the ideal which could unite diverse races and creed.\n\nThe last decade of Khalifa Sahib\u2019s life was his most productive in promoting the universal values of Islam. Scholars including Khalifa Sahib published a large number of books with progressive approaches toward relevant issues based on the fundamentals of Islam in consonance with the changing contexts and needs of the time. The progressive spirit smothered by the self-styled orthodox clergy could be countered by free thinkers and reformists who could point the way towards achieving progress towards an egalitarian society. \n\nTo lead to a welfare state necessary legislation was required to ensure accountability at all levels of elected members and administrators. To this effect, Khalifa Sahib took an active part in commissions leading to such reform. His reformist approach to issues of religious education, governance, rule of law based on equity and protection of fundamental liberties was the progressive way forward. Khalifa Sahib\u2019s monograph on Iqbal aur Mullah was once a text in the Urdu Department of Punjab University. It highlighted the differences in Iqbal\u2019s faith and those of the reactionary clerics and was distributed by the military during the Ahmadi riots of 1953 in Lahore, \n\nThe archives of Khalifa Sahib show that scholars and leaders were constantly reaching out to him. The Aga Khan III who was one of the founders and the first permanent president of the All-India Muslim League shared Sir Syed Ahmad Khan's belief that Muslims should first build up their social capital through advanced education before engaging in politics. In 1950 he wrote two letters to Khalifa Sahib addressing him as one knowledgeable on Moslem and Eastern philosophy and proposed a meeting. In 1952, Filmer Northrop a Professor of Philosophy and Law at Yale University was delighted to have established contact with Khalifa Sahib and sought further enlightenment on his book entitled Islamic Ideology. In another letter in 1956 Dr Freeland Abbott of the Department of History at Tufts University, USA followed up on an earlier meeting to discuss theological transcendentalism comparing the Quranic story of Adam and Eve as close to Wren-Lewis\u2019 interpretation of the Biblical story. \n\nGhulam Muhammad who was the Governor-General of Pakistan from 1951-55 greatly respected Khalifa Sahib who had been his classmate at the Sheranwala Gate School in the walled city of Lahore. Ghulam Muhammad was from the Audit and Accounts Service in British India and in 1942 was assigned as an advisor to the Nizam of Hyderabad. In 1951, Khalifa Sahib was invited by the University of Notre Dame in USA to address the 5th Convocation of Natural Law where he spoke on the \u2018\u2019The Natural Law in the Moslem Tradition\u2019\u2019. The Government of Pakistan arranged for Khalifa Sahib to remain in the US and embark on a lecture tour to present the progressive values of Islam that had universal appeal as One God, One World, One Humanity. The Journal of Pakistan Affairs compiled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that during the tour, he addressed audiences in 30 cities from the East Coast to the West and from Chicago down to Dallas. He also addressed audiences in cities, which were hotspots of the Civil Rights Movement like Atlanta, Georgia and Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nHe emphasised that religion is a comprehension of natural law and to be true to oneself and fellow beings one should follow the natural law and thereby be true to God. When a person turns to God sincerely, the disturbed equilibrium of life is restored and sin does not stick to his soul. He reiterated in Islam both males and females had fundamental human rights as well as civil rights and economic independence before other creeds or cultures had attempted it. Women\u2019s right to inheritance, holding property in her name, choosing a marriage partner and divorce were all granted by Islam. His message was heard in Pakistan too and he was appointed the Secretary of the Commission on Muslim Family Laws of Pakistan, which legislated the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961 protecting women and family rights. \n\nWhen Nawab Gurmani became Governor of West Pakistan in 1955, Khalifa Sahib was his literary speechwriter. He advised the Governor to establish a high-caliber translation bureau that would convert to Urdu books on all subjects as was practiced in Osmania University. In 1956, Khalifa Sahib was back in USA on an extensive lecture tour. The objective was to familiarise well-read audiences with the concepts of Islamic Ideology and Democracy. He also discussed topics related to Pakistan\u2019s problems; its attitude towards Russia and America, and Islam and Communism, America\u2019s support of Western Imperialism and Colonialism and its neglect of the Muslim world. The tour achieved a measure of success in familiarising the aims and ideals as well as the problems of Pakistan and removing misunderstandings related to Islam. Khalifa Sahib\u2019s interactions with intelligentsia in inter-faith dialogues acted as a small bridge between East and West.\n\nOn his way back from the US, he addressed a Convention on Interfaith Dialogue organised in Lebanon by the Friends of the Middle East. He also contributed an article titled \u2018How can Islam transmit its Values to the Younger Generation\u2019\u2019. He wanted a cultural renaissance where scientific and critical studies became a feature of the future. A year later he headed east to attend a UNESCO-sponsored conference in Canberra of East-West Philosophers whose purpose was to improve the understanding of the cultures of East and West. \n\nKhalifa Sahib authored twelve books on various topics related to philosophy, Islamic Ideology, Jalal ud Din Rumi and Allama Iqbal\u2019s thoughts. His book Afkar-e-Ghalib elaborates on the philosophical thoughts in Ghalib\u2019s poetry. Khalifa Sahib himself had been writing verse since he was a student. According to some recognised poets of that period, he showed a lot of promise, however, it was only later in life that he occasionally wrote poetic works. However, a selection of his expresses a deep imprint of his philosophical bent of mind and tendency towards spirituality. Khalifa Sahib\u2019s compendium of poems though in simple verse are profound and convey the universal truths of daily life, e.g. Hasrat e Benam (the desire that has no name), shows that man experiences pain, fame and toils to strive yet there is always an unfulfilled desire that has no name, and Gheree Kushhi Ghera Gham, (Immense joy and deep pain), shows that all emotions emanate from the heart and so are spiritual treasures. He also translated poems of Longfellow\u2019s and wrote on the beauty of Kashmir, a subject close to his heart. \n\nRadio was also one of the mediums through which Khalifa Sahib conveyed his message on the oneness of God. His talks broadcast by Radio Pakistan were on Iqbal\u2019s concept of God, Insaan or What Constitutes a Man and on Communist Views on Religion that compared what Communism claimed to be with what their leaders actually practiced. In 1956, his talk on Islam was aired by the New Zealand Broadcasting Service, as part of their series on world religions and in January 1959, Radio Pakistan invited Khalifa Sahib for a talk on liberal thinking and intellectual freedom in the Holy Quran, for the Quaid e Azam Memorial Lectures. Sadly, this was not to be as he had a massive heart attack on January 30 while attending a conference in Karachi and breathed his last. He was survived by his wife Khadija, son Arif Hakim and daughter Dr Rafia Hasan who retired as Professor and Chairperson of the Institute of Applied Psychology, Punjab University, Lahore.\n\nWhat was Khalifa Sahib as a man? He was a role model with complete faith that God would look after him in all circumstances. He believed in and tried to practice the true values and spirit of Islam \u2013 not just the rituals and developed a very balanced personality. He was seldom annoyed and treated the servants and the poor as equals. He cherished his relationship with family and friends, and had a pleasant nature with a sense of humor and wit which made everyone seek his company and remember him; Acquiring wealth was his least priority because he believed in higher values as worthy of pursuit. He never let material losses depress him in life as he looked at things philosophically and was optimistic and hopeful at all times.\n\nKhalifa Sahib\u2019s memory lives on in his ideas and writings. In 1975 Justice Rehman laid the foundation for an annual memorial lecture that has been delivered in his honor at Lahore and for the past five decades; eminent scholars have spoken on relevant subjects. In 2001 his daughter Dr Rafia Hasan and his granddaughter Dr Naveed Henderson were invited to Delhi for the book launch of a translation done by Khalifa Sahib of the Bhagavad Gita. This versified Urdu translation captured the spirit of the Gita like no previous normal translation and reflects Khalifa Sahib\u2019s appreciation of the universal values expressed in other faiths. The book launch of his translation was done by an Indian educational trust and sponsored by a businessman from Pune. The chief guest was then Prime Minister of India Atal Behari Vajpayee.\n\nKhalifa Sahib has left a treasure trove of his thoughts and ideas for posterity. All books, articles, poems and letters authored by him are available for free download on http://www.khalifaabdulhakim.com\n\n\u00a0\n\nDr Naveed Hasan Henderson, business historian, is the granddaughter of Dr Khalifa Abdul Hakim and Founding Director of the Management Studies Department at Government College University Lahore and can be reached at naveedhasan@yahoo.com; Major General Syed Ali Hamid, military historian and author is the grandnephew of Dr Khalifa Abdul Hakim and can be reached at syedali4955@gmail.com.

            "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAmidst a sea of conversation about whether or not Netflix is providing the quality content it was once known for, certain releases prove to be a welcome addition, making one want to stay subscribed for a while longer to experience what else may be in store. It helps, further, when that release is an Alia Bhatt starrer; an actor who has not disappointed during the course of her career, often gracing the screen with powerful and memorable performances. With a recent hit like Gangubai Kathiawadi under her wing, all eyes were on Darlings, the actor's own production project with Gauri Khan, that stars Vijay Varma and Shefali Shah. The dark, gritty, no-holds-barred film tackles the theme of domestic violence in a unique manner, and the way in which this is done has been questioned, and debated over, by many. \n\nThe story of Darlings follows the tale of a cheerful, bubbly woman named Badrunissa, or Badru, as she is affectionately known, who looks forward to marrying the love of her life, Hamza Shaikh. Belonging to a lower socioeconomic, Muslim background, Hamza is shown to propose to Badru once he secures a government job. It is here that we understand that the titular call of affection is, in fact, how the lead duo refer to each other - a consistency in the way Bollywood depicts those from lower income backgrounds. There has, of course, been a fair bit of discourse around the film making the low-income Hamza, a Muslim man, the abuser. Perhaps it was unintentional, perhaps it was a way to resist, given the current socio political climate of India. Or perhaps, audiences are reading into it, given that Badru also plays a Muslim woman who fights back. For an in-depth deep dive, opening this up for debate is, perhaps, the best option.\n\nFrom the point of the proposal, where the couple is seen embracing themselves and their happily ever after, Darlings ventures forth to provide an answer to the age-old question: what comes after happily ever after? The film jumps forward a few years, at a point where Badru wishes to introduce a child into the equation, with Hamza offering reasons as to why the process should be delayed. However, it is upon him discovering pebbles in his food that the audience learns of his tendency to physically assault Badru - a matter that has been unfolding for many years, according to Badru's mother (played by Shefali Shah). Every morning, Hamza wakes up and apologizes, and Badru relents eventually, being convinced in one way or another by her husband who makes tall promises, with no intention of keeping them. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWithout touching further upon the actual story, for as predictable as it is, it is also one that must be experienced by anyone who is either an Alia Bhatt, Vijay Varma, or Shefali Shah fan, as there are certain things that the film does brilliantly. It captures the nuances of domestic violence, and it feels like one is experiencing a textbook checklist of all that a victim may go through whilst involved in a relationship as toxic as the one shared between Hamza and Badru. From being gaslit and made to question her reality, to be swayed by love bombing and promises of offspring, to triggering her eventual mental, downward spiral, the abuser does it all, and we see a Stockholm Syndrome-stricken Badru deal with the consequences in a horrifying aftermath. Whether it was inadvertent or overt, the gendered power differential that exists between victims and their abusers is addressed subtly - a fact that may be lost in translation for many who choose to focus on the latter half of the film that propels one into a fantastical, self-appointed vigilante justice mode. \n\nDarlings is a spectacular dark comedy - a genre that is hard to straddle whilst dealing with a topic like domestic violence. In previous Bollywood films, we've seen domestic violence as a norm - a thing that happens and is paid no heed to. Actors can be violent towards their other halfs. They may even express this violence as a form of love, and justify it - something that is brilliantly touched upon in this film as well. Darlings opens up the conversation around domestic violence as a communal problem - one that exists between four walls, yes, but when screams of the victim penetrate those walls, the silence on part of the neighboring community becomes deafening. \n\nMany argue that Darlings makes light of domestic violence. For me, it hit the nail right on the head. It is, by no means, telling victims to mutilate their abusers. It asks the question: what if they did? Would the conversation then become about retaliation, as it has? Would the initial abuse be absolved, simply because there is pushback? Is victimhood a cross women alone must bear? \n\nWhen a film like Kabir Singh becomes a massive hit, women are asked to ignore the domestic violence aspect of things. We are taking things too seriously, and are not suspending our disbelief enough. However, when a film like Darlings turns the tables, the conversation becomes about normalizing domestic violence. The fact of the matter is that we are not accustomed to watching women rustle feathers in terms of the status quo. For Kabir Singh to become a cultural icon, and for Badru to be dismissed as a scorned woman who should have sought help is an unfair parallel to draw, for a multitude of reasons. \n\nOne learning that I have personally taken away while watching and reviewing any material is that empathy is key. I can have empathy for Badru, while simultaneously not condoning her actions, all while also understanding why they were necessary in the first place. Moreover, when we as viewers consume content, we must also understand that not every character we see is meant to be turned into a hero. For instance, BoJack Horseman, a popular animated series, centres its narrative around an alcoholic, once-famous actor who hurts those around him and must learn to come to terms with the consequences of his actions. While the character is deeply complex, the showrunners make it a point to highlight that it is not one for whom we must root. In fact, a mirror is held to audiences to reflect upon the instances of BoJack they can recognize in themselves. BoJack is not a hero. Kabir Singh is not a hero. Badru is not a hero. They are flawed characters who are the amalgam of their circumstances, and must be seen as such. \n\nKeeping this in mind, one can then fully appreciate how artfully Alia Bhatt tackles Badru, and depicts her mental tussle between forgiving Hamza and harming him. Vijay Varma must be applauded for his portrayal of Hamza, who we part fear, part resent as his many shades come to light. Watching him play a \"bichoo,\" or scorpion - a callback of sorts for She fans who saw him play Sasya - in Badru's mother's fable is an exhilarating experience. Shefali Shah knocks it out of the park as the mother, and Roshan Mathew deserves a special shout-out for his performance as Zulfi. It must be noted, however, that despite great performances, the film could have done with a crisper edit, trimming at least thirty minutes of the film to imbibe a faster pace. \n\nAll in all, Darlings tackles a sensitive theme in a rather fascinating manner, making for an engaging watch that has one at the edge of their seat. With a stellar cast, and an intriguing unfolding of events, the film is not just one that hooks one in, but also allows one to participate in a pertinent, albeit heated debate about partner violence, toxic relationships, and on whom the onus lies in such precarious situations. \n\n\t\t\t",
