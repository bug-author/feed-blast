They have dropped by $30 per barrel from a peak in June, but remain close to $100.\n\nThe high oil price has been a major factor in the inflationary pain suffered by consumers worldwide but have led to windfall profits for oil majors and producer countries.\n\nOil giant Saudi Aramco on Sunday unveiled record profits of $48.4 billion in the second quarter of 2022, the biggest quarterly adjusted profit of any listed company worldwide, according to Bloomberg news agency.\n\nNet income leapt 90 per cent year-on-year for the world's biggest oil producer, which clocked its second straight quarterly record after announcing $39.5 billion for the year's first three-month period.\n\nSaudi Arabia has sought to open up and diversify its oil-reliant economy, especially since Mohammed bin Salman's appointment as crown prince and de facto ruler in 2017.\n\nAbu Dhabi-based energy expert Ibrahim Elghitany said the oil bonanza was a \"golden opportunity\" for the kingdom, creating the large surpluses that would be needed to finance its non-oil development plans.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1531775-aramco-1508045857/1531775-aramco-1508045857.jpg"}, {"headline": "Pakistan’s tech firm bags ‘Forbes Asia’s Best Under A Billion’ award", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372539/pakistans-tech-firm-bags-forbes-asias-best-under-a-billion-award", "date_published": "Mon, 22 Aug 22 15:02:26 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tPakistan’s information technology company, Systems Limited, made history by being the country’s only tech firm to be awarded ‘Forbes Asia’s Best Under A Billion’ for the third time in a row.\n\nForbes Asia has recently compiled its annual list of the top 200 companies from the Asia-Pacific region with consistent top and bottom-line growth and under $1 billion in revenue.\n\nThis list entails 75 returnees that outperformed across all performance indicators and metrics; Systems Limited is among them.

The FIR also carries Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.\n\nThe FIR was lodged hours before another Islamabad police station received a written complaint from a resident of G-11/2 for lodging a case against Imran over making hate-speeches, and inciting rebellion against the army, police and judiciary.\n\nThe FIR lodged by the Margalla police said that the PTI chief threatened the additional sessions judge of Islamabad with a view to terrorise the high officials of the police and the judiciary, so that they could not fulfil their duties and refrain from taking action against the PTI due to fear of Imran.\n\nProtective bail\n\nEarlier today, Imran was granted a pre-arrest bail till August 25 by the Islamabad High Court in the same case after he approached the court amid reports that the authorities were planning to arrest him.\n\nThe bail plea was heard by Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Babar Sattar, who approved the bail and ordered him to approach the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) within these three days.\n\nImran’s counsel, Babar Awan and Faisal Chaudhry, argued that the PTI chief should be granted protective bail as he wanted to appear before the ATC, but his house was “surrounded by the police”.\n\nAlso read: Answering the call: PTI supporters continue arriving at Bani Gala\n\nThey further feared that the police personnel could arrest Imran if he appeared in court without a protective bail.\n\nThe PTI chief’s counsel stated that the concerned ATC judge was on leave hence, the high court had to be approached.\n\nCoalition parties want Imran penalised\n\nThe coalition parties of the incumbent government had earlier urged the superior judiciary to take immediate notice of former prime minister Imran Khan's threat to a female judge during his F-9 Park speech.\n\n“Take legal action against Imran Khan and his colleagues for interfering in the affairs of the interior minister and threatening the officers and government staff who are performing their duties according to the law,” according to a joint statement issued on Saturday.\n\nThe statement strongly condemned the speech delivered by Imran on Saturday night in which a female judge was named and threatened, while an attempt was made to intimidate the Islamabad IG and DIG.\n\n“These threats are blatant bullying and lawlessness. Imran is the chairman of a traitorous foreign-aided party and a recipient of foreign funding, who has plotted a coup in Pakistan Army.”\n\nSCBA welcomes the move\n\nThe Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) welcomed the Islamabad High Court's decision to initiate contempt proceeding against Imran Khan.\n\nSCBA President Ahsan Bhoon lambasted the way in which the name of female Additional Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Zeba Chaudhry was hurled publicly, saying it was was not only offensive and derogatory but also undermined the dignity and prestige of the entire judicial system.\n\n“His [Imran Khan’s] such conduct also exposed how much he cares about the respect and reverence of honorable Judges. Being the apex bar of the country, this association cannot turn a blind eye towards such malicious acts, which undermines the dignity, decorum and prestige of our Judiciary. Time and again, this association has maintained that everyone is free to express his/her disagreement with judgement but no one is free to harm the respect and dignity of Judges.”\n\nThe SCBA president in the statement further added that, “Let no one be mistaken that SCBAP in particular and the entire legal fraternity in general, will not allow anyone to sabotage the dignity and repute of our institutions, especially judiciary come what may”.\n\nHe also demanded to take strict cognisance against those found involved in such contemptuous act with ‘iron fist’, so that no one dares to indulge in such malicious act, ever again.\n\n\t\t\t", "image_url": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/imrankhanlahorehockeyscreen1660413652-0/imrankhanlahorehockeyscreen1660413652-0.jpg"}, {"headline": "At least 20 dead in central Afghanistan floods", "link": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2372529/at-least-20-dead-in-central-afghanistan-floods", "date_published": "Mon, 22 Aug 22 12:37:03 +0500", "details": "\n\t\t\t\tAt least 20 people have been killed in flash floods in central Afghanistan over the last 48 hours, a disaster management official said on Monday, with heavy rain destroying thousands of homes and damaging agricultural land.\n\nThe country has been reeling from natural disasters this year, including a drought and a massive earthquake that killed over 1,000 people in June.\n\n\n\nDisplaced Afghan families spend time together after the heavy flood in the Khushi district of Logar, Afghanistan, August 21, 2022.
